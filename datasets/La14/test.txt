I	O
expected	O

I	O

to	O

OS	I-A

This	O
mac	O
has	O
been	O
a	O
problem	O
since	O
we	O
got	O
it.	O

Sure	O
it's	O
not	O
light	O
and	O
slim	O
but	O
the	O

	O
make	O
up	O
for	O
it	O
100%.	O

Made	O

	O
(part	O
of	O

very	O
difficult	O
to	O
maintain.	O

Luckily,	O
for	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
contemplating	O
the	O
decision,	O
the	O
Mac	O
Mini	O
is	O
priced	B-A
	O
just	O
right.	O

Small	O
and	O
still	O
VERY	O
powerful.	O

I	O
had	O
gotten	O
this	O
model	O
for	O
$1199.00	O
on	O
my	O
State's	O
tax-free	O
weekend	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
$100	O
off	O
coupon	O
for	O
a	O
MacBook	O
at	O
the	O
local	O
BestBuy!	O

Super	O
light,	O
super	O
sexy	O
and	O
everything	O
just	O
works	B-A
.	O

Only	O
problem	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
was	O
that	O
the	O
track	B-A
pad	I-A
	O
was	O
not	O
very	O
good	O
for	O
me,	O
I	O
only	O
had	O
a	O
problem	O
once	O
or	O
twice	O
with	O
it,	O
But	O
probably	O
my	O
computer	O
was	O
a	O
bit	O
defective.	O

And	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
switching	O
from	O
a	O
pc	O
I	O
hilghy	O
sugest	O
this	O
one.	O

It	O
is	O
super	O
fast	O
and	O
has	O
outstanding	O
graphics	B-A
.	O

But	O
the	O
mountain	B-A
lion	I-A
	O
is	O
just	O
too	O
slow.	O

Strong	O
build	B-A
	O
though	O
which	O
really	O
adds	O
to	O
its	O
durability	B-A
.	O

The	O
battery	B-A
life	I-A
	O
is	O
excellent-	O
6-7	O
hours	O
without	O
charging.	O

I	O
enjoy	O
having	O
apple	O
products.	O

I've	O
had	O
my	O
computer	O
for	O
2	O
weeks	O
already	O
and	O
it	O
works	B-A
	O
perfectly.	O

I	O
will	O
never	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
a	O
PC	O
again!	O

And	O
I	O
may	O
be	O
the	O
only	O
one	O
but	O
I	O
am	O
really	O
liking	O
Windows	B-A
8	I-A
.	O

The	O
baterry	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
longer.	O

And	O
it's	O
so	O
quiet	O
that	O
I	O
don't	O
hear	O
it	O
at	O
all.	O

Its	O
size	B-A
	O
is	O
ideal	O
and	O
the	O
weight	B-A
	O
is	O
acceptable.	O

I	O
know	O
Apples	O
are	O
more	O
expensive	O
than	O
PCs,	O
but	O
he	O
thinks	O
it	O
is	O
worth	O
every	O
penny.	O

To	O
me	O
it's	O
a	O
workhorse...	O
and	O
quiet	O
as	O
can	O
be...	O
you	O
even	O
save	O
big	O
bucks	O
not	O
dishing	O
out	O
any	O
extra	O
to	O
Uncle	O
Sam...	O
Definite	O
Buy...	O

I	O
can	O
say	O
that	O
I	O
am	O
fully	O
satisfied	O
with	O
the	O
performance	B-A
	O
that	O
the	O
computer	O
has	O
supplied.	O

I'm	O
pretty	O
sure	O
when	O
I	O
bought	O
it,	O
my	O
bank	O
account	O
went	O
'ouch!	O

Thank	O
you	O
so	O
much	O
for	O
the	O
great	O
item.	O

This	O
laptop	O
has	O
only	O
2	O
USB	B-A
ports	I-A
,	O
and	O
they	O
are	O
both	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
side.	O

It's	O
annoying	O
very	O
much	O
and	O
I	O
won't	O
ever	O
buy	O
any	O
Acer	O
products.	O

This	O
is	O
why	O
I	O
purchased	O
a	O
BRAND	O
NEW	O
LAPTOP	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
so	O
it	O
wouldn't	O
have	O
ANY	O
problems.	O

It	O
has	O
so	O
much	O
more	O
speed	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
screen	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
sharp.	O

As	O
for	O
the	O
laptop,	O
this	O
is	O
our	O
3rd	O
Apple	O
computer	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
2	O
years.	O

Everything	O
I	O
wanted	O
and	O
everything	O
I	O
needed	O
and	O
the	O
price	B-A
	O
was	O
great!	O

It's	O
not	O
inexpensive	O
but	O
the	O
Hardware	B-A
performance	I-A
	O
is	O
impressive	O
for	O
a	O
computer	O
this	O
small.	O

It	O
is	O
better	O
than	O
my	O
old	O
acer	O
laptop.	O

This	O
thing	O
is	O
awesome,	O
everything	O
always	O
works	B-A
,	O
everything	O
is	O
always	O
easy	O
to	O
set	B-A
up	I-A
,	O
everything	O
is	O
compatible,	O
its	O
literally	O
everything	O
I	O
could	O
ask	O
for.	O

I	O
would	O
buy	O
it	O
again	O
in	O
a	O
heartbeat!	O

Keyboard	B-A
	O
responds	O
well	O
to	O
presses.	O

If	O
someone	O
called	O
me	O
an	O
Apple	O
Fanboy...it	O
would	O
make	O
sense.	O

Lastly,	O
Windows	B-A
8	I-A
	O
is	O
annoying.	O

A	O
scratch	O
on	O
a	O
$1,500	O
MacBook	O
is	O
unforgivable.	O

I	O
just	O
fell	O
in	O
love	O
with	O
this	O
thing.	O

Everything	O
is	O
so	O
easy	O
and	O
intuitive	O
to	O
setup	B-A
	O
or	O
configure	B-A
.	O

I	O
have	O
no	O
problems	O
yet	O
on	O
my	O
mac	O
so	O
far,	O
and	O
hope	O
it	O
stays	O
like	O
that.	O

This	O
laptop	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
buy.	O

Biggest	O
complaint	O
is	O
Windows	B-A
8	I-A
	O
.	O

Only	O
2	O
usb	B-A
ports	I-A
...seems	O
kind	O
of...limited.	O

It	O
has	O
been	O
to	O
early	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
this	O
actually	O
fixes	O
the	O
problem	O
or	O
not	O
though.	O

This	O
device	O
has	O
met	O
my	O
expectations	O
and	O
I'm	O
sure	O
it	O
will	O
meet	O
yours.	O

It	O
has	O
all	O
the	O
expected	O
features	B-A
	O
and	O
more	O
+plus	O
a	O
wide	O
screen	B-A
	O
and	O
more	O
than	O
roomy	O
keyboard	B-A
.	O

Out	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
laptops	O
I	O
have	O
owned,	O
this	O
is	O
by	O
far	O
the	O
best!	O

Amazing	O
Performance	B-A
	O
for	O
anything	O
I	O
throw	O
at	O
it.	O

I	O
can	O
never	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
a	O
PC	O
now,	O
this	O
machine	O
never	O
freezes	O
or	O
has	O
any	O
problems.	O

Out	O
of	O
the	O
box	O
I	O
noticed	O
how	O
small	O
it	O
was	O
and	O
was	O
exactly	O
what	O
I	O
was	O
looking	O
for.	O

The	O
receiver	O
was	O
full	O
of	O
superlatives	O
for	O
the	O
quality	B-A
	O
and	O
performance	B-A
.	O

I	O
was	O
extremely	O
happy	O
with	O
the	O
OS	B-A
	O
itself.	O

I	O
was	O
looking	O
for	O
something	O
in	O
between	O
a	O
regular	O
laptop	O
and	O
a	O
tablet	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
it.	O

The	O
new	O
MBP	O
offers	O
great	O
portability	B-A
	O
and	O
gives	O
us	O
confidence	O
that	O
we	O
are	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
need	O
to	O
purchase	O
a	O
new	O
laptop	O
in	O
18	O
months.	O

Great	O
purchase	O
and	O
I	O
definitely	O
didn't	O
miss	O
out	O
on	O
the	O
Black	O
Friday	O
deals.	O

The	O
criticism	O
has	O
waned,	O
and	O
now	O
I'd	O
be	O
the	O
first	O
to	O
recommend	O
an	O
Air	O
for	O
truly	O
portable	B-A
computing	I-A
.	O

I	O
would	O
have	O
given	O
it	O
5	O
starts	O
was	O
it	O
not	O
for	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
it	O
had	O

MS	B-A
Office	I-A
2011	I-A
for	I-A
Mac	I-A
	O
is	O
wonderful,	O
well	O
worth	O
it.	O

After	O
using	O
it	O
for	O
over	O
a	O
month,	O
an	O
issue	O
started	O
to	O
surface.	O

But	O
the	O
performance	B-A
	O
of	O
Mac	O
Mini	O
is	O
a	O
huge	O
disappointment.	O

There	O
has	O
been	O
no	O
problem	O
with	O
anything.	O

I	O
believe	O
with	O
Apple	O
-	O
you	O
get	O
what	O
you	O
pay	O
for.	O

They	O
don't	O
just	O
look	B-A
	O
good;	O
they	O
deliver	O
excellent	O
performance	B-A
.	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
it	O
over	O
a	O
year	O
now	O
with	O
out	O
a	O

is	O
Fast	O

The	O

to	O
figure	O
out	O
if	O
you	O
are	O

Microsoft	B-A

However,	O
I	O
can	O
refute	O
that	O
OSX	B-A

"FAST".	O

I	O
waited	O
to	O

I	O

to	O
anyone.	O

With	O
no	O

I'm	O
happy	O
with	O
this	O

it	O
anywhere	O

Incredible	O

I	O
needed	O
something	O

from	O
Apple	O
and	O
was	O
tired	O
of	O
dealing	O
with	O
PC	O
laptop	O
after	O

Just	O
bit	O
the	O
bullet	O
and	O
bought	O
the	O

hoping	O
it	O
will	O
last	O
a	O

longer….	O

Built-in	B-A

Once	O

how	O
to	O
use	O
the	O
poorly	O
designed	O
Windows	B-A

	O
you	O
may	O
feel	O
frustrated.	O

Very	O
powerful	O
especially	O
for	O
the	O
money.	O

When	O
my	O
Dell	O
laptop	O
gave	O
up	O
only	O
after	O
2	O
1/2	O
years,	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
buy	O
MacBook	O
Pro.	O

It's	O
been	O
time	O
for	O
a	O
new	O
laptop,	O
and	O
the	O
only	O
debate	O
was	O
which	O
size	B-A
	O
of	O
the	O
Mac	O
laptops,	O
and	O
whether	O
to	O
spring	O
for	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
significantly	O
more	O
affordable	O
than	O
getting	O
a	O
new	O
MacBook	O
Pro	O
from	O
Apple.	O

I	O
have	O
always	O
wanted	O
a	O
MacBook	O
Pro.....always!	O

The	O
reason	O
why	O
I	O
choose	O
apple	O
MacBook	O
because	O
of	O
their	O
design	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
aluminum	B-A

The	O
aluminum	B-A

	O
sure	O
makes	O
it	O

Overall	O
it's	O
an	O

It	O

Nothing	O

mac,	O
blew	O
me	O
away	O
completely.	O

The	O
durability	B-A
	O
of	O
the	O
laptop	O
will	O
make	O
it	O
worth	O
the	O
money.	O

Well	O
designed	B-A
	O
and	O
fast.	O

And	O
now	O
I	O
am	O
a	O
proud	O
MacBook	O
owner	O
also!	O

But	O
I	O
was	O
completely	O
wrong,	O
this	O
computer	O
is	O
UNBELIEVABLE	O
amazing	O
and	O
easy	O
to	O
use	B-A

Exactly	O
as	O

plus	O
a	O
great	O

The	O

	O
are	O
pretty	O
good	O
too.	O

I	O
am	O
having	O
a	O
friend	O
look	O
at	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
will	O
probably	O
return	O
it.	O

There	O
were	O
no	O
scratches	O
or	O

or	O
any	O
marks	O
at	O
all.	O

I've	O
only	O
had	O
it	O
one	O
day,	O
but	O
I	O
really	O
do	O
love	O
it	O
and	O
I'm	O
happy	O
it	O
was	O
economical	O
and	O
I'm	O
finally	O
able	O
to	O
own	O
a	O
Mac!	O

Since	O
I	O
have	O
always	O
used	O
Apple	O
products,	O
the	O
choice	O
of	O

obvious.	O

Apple	O

I	O

to	O
any	O
one	O

for	O
a	O

I	O
do	O
not	O

Startup	B-A

	O
are	O

I	O

from	O
Best	O
Buy	O
under	O
a	O
year	O

The	O

is	O
really	O

Also	O

it	O

great	O
price	B-A
	O
free	O

	O
what	O
else	O
can	O
i	O
ask	O
for!!	O

This	O
mouse	B-A
	O
is	O
terrific.	O

I	O
will	O
also	O
say	O
it	O
is	O
much	O
better	O
than	O
I	O
expected!	O

This	O
computer	O
does	O
everything	O
i	O
need	O
it	O
to	O
do	O
for	O
school	O
and	O
more.	O

It	O
is	O
really	O
thick	O
around	O
the	O
battery	B-A
.	O

And	O
windows	B-A

	O
works	O
like	O
a	O
charm.	O

And	O
I	O
can	O
attach	O

:]	O
It	O
arrived	O
so	O
fast	O
and	O
customer	B-A
service	I-A
	O
was	O
great.	O

tried	O
windows	B-A
8	I-A
	O
and	O
hated	O
it	O
!!!	O

The	O
price	B-A
	O
is	O
higher	O
than	O
most	O
lab	O
top	O
out	O
there;	O
however,	O
he/she	O
will	O
get	O
what	O
they	O
paid	O
for,	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
computer.	O

So,	O
I	O
thought	O
why	O
not	O
give	O
Mac	O
Book	O
pro	O
a	O
try.	O

Set	B-A
up	I-A
	O
was	O
a	O
breeze.	O

But	O
I	O
do	O
NOT	O
like	O
Win8	B-A
.	O

I	O
have	O
owned	O
at	O
least	O
4	O
to	O
5	O
laptops	O
and	O
computers	O
-	O
but	O
this	O
is	O
by	O
far	O
the	O
most	O
superior	O
machine	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
owned.	O

I	O
am	O
still	O
in	O
the	O
process	O
of	O
learning	O
about	O
its	O
features	B-A
.	O

BTW,	O
I	O
checked	O
online	O
regarding	O
the	O
old	O
laptop	O
that	O
'died'	O
and	O
found	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
alone,	O
far	O
from	O
it.	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
same	O
reasons	O
as	O
most	O
PC	O
users:	O
the	O
price	B-A
,	O
the	O
overbearing	O
restrictions	O
of	O
OSX	B-A
	O
and	O
lack	O
of	O
support	B-A
for	I-A
games	I-A
.	O

I	O
wanted	O
it	O
for	O
it's	O
mobility	B-A
	O
and	O
man,	O
this	O
little	O
bad	O
boy	O
is	O
very	O
nice.	O

Seems	O
to	O
me	O
that's	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
to	O
get	O
Apple's	O
attention.	O

Very	O
nice	O
so	O
far.	O

You	O
won't	O
be	O
disappointed.	O

The	O
investment	O
of	O
a	O
new	O
MacBook	O
Pro	O
came	O
at	O
a	O
price	B-A
,	O
but	O
totally	O
worth	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
piece	O
of	O
mind.	O

I	O
found	O
the	O
mini	O
to	O
be:Exceptionally	O
easy	O
to	O
set	B-A
up	I-A
	O

Having	O
USB3	B-A
	O
is	O
why	O
I	O
bought	O
this	O
Mini.	O

Be	O
sure	O
to	O
have	O
good	O
air	O
flow	O
where	O
ever	O
you	O
put	O
it.	O

The	O
sound	B-A
	O
is	O
nice	O
and	O
loud;	O
I	O
don't	O
have	O
any	O
problems	O
with	O
hearing	O
anything.	O

It	O
is	O
very	O
slim,	O
the	O
track	B-A
pad	I-A
	O
is	O
very	O
much	O
impressed	O
with	O
me.	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
same	O
problem	O
with	O
my	O
MacBook	O
(circa	O
2007)	O
that	O
I	O
just	O
retired.	O

Great	O
things	O

HUGE	O
Apple	O

Looked	O
at	O
HP,	O
ASUS,	O
Acer,	O
Sony	O
and	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
other	O
ones	O
but	O
could	O
not	O
find	O
I	O
really	O
liked.	O

The	O
settings	B-A
	O
are	O
not	O
user-friendly	O
either.	O

Honestly,	O
I	O
am	O
surprised	O
no	O
one	O
else	O
has	O
mentioned	O
returning	O
theirs.	O

Most	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
either	O
too	O
big,	O
too	O
noisy	O
and	O
too	O
slow	O
after	O
2	O
years.	O

The	O
machine	O
is	O
used,	O
but	O
is	O
like	O
new,	O
i'm	O
very	O

Needless	O
to	O
say,	O
the	O
leap	O
from	O
that	O
to	O
this	O
has	O
been	O
amazing	O
and	O
(aside	O
from	O
the	O
financial	O
reasons)	O
I	O
am	O
astounded	O
that	O
I	O
hadn't	O
made	O
the	O
switch	O
sooner.	O

Its	O
perfect,	O
not	O
much	O
heavy.	O

i	O
love	O
the	O
keyboard	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
screen	B-A
.	O

I	O
find	O
it	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
user	O
friendly.	O

It	O
has	O
surpassed	O
all	O
expectations	O
and	O
fulfilled	O
all	O
my	O
needs.	O

However,	O
there	O
are	O
MAJOR	O
issues	O
with	O
the	O
touchpad	B-A
	O
which	O
render	O
the	O
device	O
nearly	O
useless.	O

What	O
angers	O
me	O
more	O
than	O
anything	O
else	O
is	O
that	O
I	O
spent	O
all	O
those	O
years	O
hating	O
MACs	O
when	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
getting	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O

with	O
a	O
whole	O

I've	O
already	O

	O
and	O
I	O
am	O

about	O

So	O
this	O
is	O
very	O
good	O

up	O

$344.99?	O

Not	O

You	O

Nothing	O

It	O

My	O

about	O
the	O

later	O
for	O
the	O
same	O
reason.	O

Minis	O
make	O
sense	O
for	O
a	O

of	O

The	O

quite	O
good,	O
and	O
built-in	B-A

	O
like	O
iPhoto	B-A
	O
work	O
great	O
with	O
my	O

and	O

This	O
Mac	O
Mini	O
makes	O
the	O
Macbook	O

seem	O
slow.	O

I	O
did	O
swap	O
out	O
the	O
hard	B-A
drive	I-A
	O
for	O
a	O
Samsung	B-A
830	I-A
SSD	I-A
	O
which	O
I	O
highly	O
recommend.	O

I	O
bought	O
this	O
MacBook	O
Pro	O
to	O
replace	O
my	O
six-year-old	O
PC	O
(a	O
Sony	O
Vaio),	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
basically	O
no	O
better	O
than	O
my	O
old	O
PC,	O
so	O
I	O
returned	O
it.	O

I	O
wanted	O
a	O
simple,	O
reliable	O
laptop.	O

Cheaper	O
than	O
buying	O
it	O
@	O
apple	O
too!	O

I	O
have	O
just	O
had	O
to	O
learn	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
harder	O
typer	O
than	O
on	O
my	O
last	O
computer.	O

Extremely	O
disappointed	O
with	O
the	O
way	O
it	O
is.	O

Never	O
been	O
happier	O
using	O
computer.	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
a	O
total	O
of	O
5	O
different	O
laptop	O
from	O
many	O
different	O
manufactures.	O

Does	O
everything	O
I	O
wanted	O
this	O
laptop	O
to	O
do.	O

Besides,	O
the	O
apple	O
stocks	O
have	O
been	O
falling	O
due	O
to	O
lack	O
of	O
sales.	O

Turns	O
out	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
common	O
problem.	O

Starts	B-A
up	I-A
	O
in	O
a	O
hurry	O
and	O
everything	O
is	O
ready	O
to	O
go.	O

It	O
is	O
also	O
fast	O
as	O
can	O
be...	O
you	O
get	O
what	O
you	O
pay	O
for...	O
well	O
worth	O
the	O
investment	O

But	O
I'm	O
still	O
learning	O
so	O
can't	O
rate	O
it	O
yet	O
for	O
everything.	O

Overall	O
very	O
impressed,	O
Thank	O
you	O
Apple	O
and	O
Amazon!	O

Yes,	O
that's	O
a	O
good	O
thing,	O
but	O
it's	O
made	O
from	O
aluminum	B-A
	O
that	O
scratches	O
easily.	O

Very	O
fast	O
for	O
my	O
needs.	O

I	O
bought	O
this	O
Mac	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
replace	O
my	O
old	O
Dell	O
laptop.	O

Quick	O
and	O
has	O
built	B-A
in	I-A
virus	I-A
control	I-A
.	O

Took	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
trying	O
to	O
decide	O
between	O
one	O
with	O
retina	B-A
display	I-A
	O
and	O
one	O
without.	O

I	O
saw	O
the	O
Mini	O
Mac	O
at	O
Best	O
Buy	O
and	O
decided	O
to	O
get	O
this	O
as	O
my	O
replacement.	O

I	O
finally	O
decided	O
on	O
this	O
one	O
and	O
couldn't	O
be	O
any	O
happier.	O

I	O
was	O
also	O
informed	O
that	O
the	O
components	B-A
	O
of	O
the	O
Mac	O
Book	O
were	O
dirty.	O

So	O
glad	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
waste	O
money	O
on	O
a	O
less	O
than	O
par	O
product.	O

Haven't	O
regretted	O
it	O
one	O
bit.	O

The	O
one	O
thing	O
that	O
Apple	O
does	O
right	O
is	O
computers.	O

the	O
hardware	B-A
	O
problems	O
have	O
been	O
so	O
bad,	O
i	O
can't	O
wait	O
till	O
it	O
completely	O
dies	O
in	O
3	O
years,	O
TOPS!	O

It's	O
so	O
nice	O
that	O
the	O
battery	B-A
	O
last	O
so	O
long	O
and	O
that	O
this	O
machine	O
has	O
the	O
snow	B-A
lion	I-A
!	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
the	O
best	O
out	O
on	O
the	O
market.	O

HOWEVER	O
I	O
chose	O
two	O
day	O
shipping	B-A
	O
and	O
it	O
took	O
over	O
a	O
week	O
to	O
arrive.	O

That's	O
quite	O
a	O
bump	O
up	O
from	O
the	O
$599	O
that	O
this	O
little	O
guy	O
sells	O
for,	O
which	O
leaves	O
me	O
to	O
my	O
next	O
point.	O

this	O
is	O
quite	O
smooth	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
heavy	O
and	O
can	O
easily	O
slip	O
through	O
the	O
hands.	O

My	O
laptop	O
is	O
so	O
light	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
take	O
it	O
with	O
me	O
anywhere.	O

it's	O
exactly	O
what	O
i	O
wanted,	O
and	O
it	O
has	O
all	O
the	O
new	O
features	B-A
	O
and	O
whatnot.	O

You	O
can	O
do	O
absolutely	O
anything	O
and	O
is	O
very	O
fast	O
and	O
stylish.	O

Finally	O
decided	O
to	O
try	O
a	O
MAC	O
because	O
there	O
were	O
too	O
many	O
choices	O
of	O
which	O
PC's	O
to	O
buy	O
and	O
EVERYONE	O
who	O
had	O
a	O
MAC	O
said	O
"buy	O
a	O
MAC".	O

Can	O
you	O
buy	O
any	O
laptop	O
that	O
matches	O
the	O
quality	B-A
	O
of	O
a	O
MacBook?	O

It	O
feels	O
cheap,	O
the	O
keyboard	B-A
	O
is	O
not	O
very	O
sensitive.	O

That	O
defeated	O
the	O
whole	O
point	O
of	O
a	O
laptop.	O

Though	O
please	O
note	O
that	O
sometimes	O
it	O
crashes,	O
and	O
the	O
sound	B-A
quality	I-A
	O
isnt	O
superb.	O

It	O
is	O
very	O
easy	O
to	O
navigate	B-A
	O
even	O
for	O
a	O
novice.	O

But	O
until	O
now,	O
no	O
complains	O
at	O
all.	O

The	O
cons	O
are	O
more	O
annoyances	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
lived	O
with.	O

Does	O
everything	O
I	O
need	O
it	O
to,	O
has	O
a	O
wonderful	O
battery	B-A
life	I-A
	O
and	O
I	O
couldn't	O
be	O
happier.	O

Great	O
Performance	B-A
	O
and	O
Quality	B-A
.	O

Just	O
What	O
I	O
Needed	O
For	O
Portable	O
And	O
My	O
Wallet	O
Too!	O

The	O
device	O
speaks	O
about	O
it	O
self.	O

I	O
used	O
windows	B-A

and	O
Windows	B-A

	O

the	O
only	O
thing	O
that	O

out	O
about	O
this	O

this	O

I	O

material	B-A
	O
as	O
the	O

I	O
bought	O
it	O
to	O
my	O
son	O
who	O
uses	O
it	O
for	O
graphic	B-A

I	O
previously	O
owned	O
an	O
older	O
Dell	O
laptop	O
that	O
died	O
after	O
about	O
5	O
or	O
6	O
years.	O

Its	O
a	O
pretty	O
decent	O
computer.	O

I	O
never	O
tried	O
any	O
external	B-A
mics	I-A
	O
with	O
that	O
iMac.	O

The	O
new	O
os	B-A
	O
is	O
great	O
on	O
my	O
macbook	O
pro!	O

It	O
was	O
fast,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
"different".	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
little	O
problem	O
adjusting	O
to	O
the	O
small	O
screen	B-A
	O
but	O
works	O
fine	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
I	O
remember	O
to	O
carry	O
my	O
glasses.	O

I	O
purchased	O
my	O
first	O
Mac	O
and	O
am	O
glad	O
I	O
did.	O

I	O
have	O
experienced	O
no	O
problems,	O
works	B-A
	O
as	O
anticipated.	O

System	B-A
	O
is	O
running	O
great.	O

Easy	O
to	O
customize	B-A
setting	I-A
	O
and	O
even	O
create	B-A
your	I-A
own	I-A
bookmarks	I-A
.	O

They	O
really	O
screwed	O
the	O
pooch	O
on	O
this	O
one.	O

The	O
MAC	O

wireless	B-A
keyboard	I-A
/	I-A
mouse	I-A
	O
and	O
a	O
HDMI	B-A
cable	I-A
	O
is	O
all	O
I	O
need	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
real	O
work	O
done.	O

I	O
finally	O
pulled	O
the	O
trigger	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
blown	O
away	O
by	O
how	O
much	O
more	O
I	O
enjoy	O
my	O
computer	O
tasks	O
using	O
the	O
Mac	O
Mini!!!	O

it	O
has	O
all	O
the	O
features	B-A
	O
that	O
we	O
expected	O
and	O
the	O
price	B-A
	O
was	O
good,	O
working	B-A
	O
well	O
so	O
far.	O

I	O
work	O
as	O
a	O
designer	O
and	O
coder	O
and	O
I	O
needed	O
a	O
new	O
buddy	O
to	O
work	O
with,	O
not	O
gaming	B-A
.	O

I	O
was	O
told	O
that	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
multi	O
-	O
component	O
failure.	O

The	O
new	O
operating	B-A
system	I-A
	O
makes	O
this	O
computer	O
into	O
a	O
super	O
iPad.	O

I	O
am	O
very	O
happy	O
with	O
my	O
first	O
Mac.	O

Easy	O
to	O
set	B-A
up	I-A
	O
and	O
go!	O

I	O
can't	O
believe	O
how	O
quiet	O
the	O
hard	B-A
drive	I-A
	O
is	O
and	O
how	O
quick	O
this	O
thing	O
boots	B-A
up	I-A
.	O

The	O
only	O
issue	O
came	O
when	O
I	O
tried	O
scanning	B-A
	O
to	O
the	O
mac.	O

The	O
machine	O
is	O
speedy	O
and	O
efficient.	O

I	O
think	O
this	O
is	O
about	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
it	O
gets	O
at	O
anything	O
close	O
to	O
this	O
price	B-A
point	I-A
.	O

A	O
*big*	O
upgrade	O
from	O
my	O
13"	O
2006	O
macbook.	O

It's	O
just	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
looking	O
for	O
and	O
it	O
works	B-A
	O
great.	O

Having	O
a	O
Mac	O
certainly	O
makes	O
life	O
easier.	O

It's	O
so	O
quick	O
and	O
responsive	O
that	O
it	O
makes	O
working	B-A
/surfing	B-A
	O
on	O
a	O
computer	O
so	O
much	O
more	O
pleasurable!	O

The	O
old	O
unibody	O
macbook	O
pro	O
could	O
fry	O
an	O
egg	O
after	O
a	O
while.	O

It	O
works	B-A
	O
fine,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
software	B-A
	O
seems	O
to	O
run	O
pretty	O
well.	O

For	O
this	O
purpose,	O
it's	O
great.	O

Couldn't	O
have	O
asked	O
for	O
more!	O

I'm	O
using	O
this	O
computer	O
for	O
word	B-A
processing	I-A
,	O
web	B-A
browsing	I-A
,	O
some	O
gaming	B-A
,	O
and	O
I'm	O
learning	O
programming	B-A
.	O

It	O
certainly	O
does,	O
but	O
you	O
rarely	O
hear	O
any	O
of	O
your	O
friends	O
with	O
Mac's	O
complain	O
about	O
anything.	O

My	O
wife	O
was	O
so	O
excited	O
to	O
open	O
the	O
box,	O
but	O
quickly	O
came	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
function	B-A
	O
as	O
it	O
should.	O

I	O
don't	O
have	O
any	O
technical	O
pearls	O
to	O
share.	O

I	O
wanted	O
a	O
computer	O
that	O
was	O
quite,	O
fast,	O
and	O
that	O
had	O
overall	O
great	O
performance	B-A
.	O

Apple	B-A
"Help"	I-A
	O
is	O
a	O
mixed	O
bag.	O

All	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
is	O
I	O
am	O
impressed.	O

It	O
suddenly	O
can	O
not	O
work	B-A
.	O

It	O
did	O
everything	O
we	O
expected!	O

Harddrive	B-A
	O
was	O
in	O
poor	O
condition,	O
had	O
to	O
replace	O
it.	O

The	O
on/off	B-A
switch	I-A
	O
is	O
a	O
bit	O
obscure	O
in	O
the	O
rear	O
corner.	O

It's	O
a	O
nice	O
little	O
gadget.	O

My	O
only	O
complaint	O
is	O
the	O
total	O
lack	O
of	O
instructions	B-A
	O
that	O
come	O
with	O
the	O
mac	O
mini.	O

The	O
only	O
task	O
that	O
this	O
computer	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
good	O
enough	O
for	O
would	O
be	O
gaming	B-A
,	O
otherwise	O
the	O
integrated	B-A
Intel	I-A
4000	I-A
graphics	I-A
	O
work	O
well	O
for	O
other	O
tasks.	O

It's	O
macbook	O
pro	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
discusion	O
about	O
it.	O

I'm	O
hoping	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
features	B-A
	O
will	O
be	O
the	O
signature	O
quality	O
of	O
apple.	O

I	O
use	O
it	O
mostly	O
for	O
content	B-A
creation	I-A
	O
(Audio	B-A
,	O
video	B-A
,	O
photo	B-A
editing	I-A
)	O
and	O
its	O
reliable.	O

It	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
all	O
around	O
Mac.	O

Screen	B-A
	O
is	O
bright	O
and	O
gorgeous.	O

Also	O
is	O
portable	O
and	O
reliable.	O

The	O
only	O
solution	O
is	O
to	O
turn	O
the	O
brightness	B-A
	O
down,	O
etc.	O

It	O
is	O
not	O
an	O
easy	O
decision	O
to	O
purchase	O
a	O
used	O
or	O
even	O
good	O
as	O
new	O
laptop	O
but	O
I	O
am	O
very	O
satisfied.	O

If	O
you	O
want	O
more	O
information	O
on	O
macs	O
I	O
suggest	O
going	O
to	O
apple.com	O
and	O
heading	O
towards	O
the	O
macbook	O
page	O
for	O
more	O
information	O
on	O
the	O
applications	B-A
.	O

It	O
is	O
robust,	O
with	O
a	O
friendly	O
use	B-A
	O
as	O
all	O
Apple	O
products.	O

Even	O
if	O
you	O
don't	O
do	O
business,	O
thats	O
okay,	O
it's	O
incredibly	O
fast.	O

It	O
is	O
fast	O
and	O
easy	O
to	O
use	B-A
.	O

This	O
was	O
absolutely	O
annoying!	O

And	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
it	O
comes	O
with	O
an	O
i5	B-A
processor	I-A
	O
definitely	O
speeds	O
things	O
up	O

But	O
for	O
those	O
of	O
you	O
that	O
dont	O
have	O
a	O
mac	O
and	O
are	O
still	O
on	O
the	O
PC's	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
good	O
foot	O
in	O
the	O
door	O
into	O
mac.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
PC	O
for	O
years	O
but	O
this	O
computer	O
is	O
intuitive	O
and	O
its	O
built	B-A
in	I-A
features	I-A
	O
are	O
a	O
great	O
help	O

and	O
it	O
fits	O
in	O
my	O
briefcase	O
with	O
ease	O

Nice	O
screen	B-A
,	O
keyboard	B-A
	O
works	O
great!	O

Still	O
not	O
bad	O
for	O
220.00.	O

I	O
was	O
amazed	O
at	O
how	O
fast	O
the	O
delivery	B-A
	O
was.	O

Good	O
computer	O
and	O
fast.	O

I've	O
installed	O
to	O
it	O
additional	O
SSD	B-A
	O
and	O
16Gb	B-A
RAM	I-A
.	O

The	O
memory	B-A
	O
was	O
gone	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
be	O
used.	O

Its	O
pretty	O
much	O
fire	O
it	O
up	O
and	O
go.	O

It	O
works	B-A
	O
great	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
so	O
happy	O
I	O
bought	O
it.	O

Let	O
me	O
start	O
off	O
by	O
saying	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
highly	O
reluctant	O
to	O
spend	O
so	O
much	O
money	O
on	O
a	O
laptop.	O

I	O
like	O
the	O
design	B-A
	O
and	O
ease	O
of	O
use	O
with	O
the	O
keyboard	B-A
,	O
plenty	O
of	O
ports	B-A
.	O

Apple	O
is	O
living	O
up	O
to	O
its	O
name	O
with	O
the	O
mini	O
and,	O
for	O
our	O
needs,	O
it's	O
perfect.	O

it	O
definitely	O
beats	O
my	O
old	O
mac	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
great.	O

I	O
went	O
from	O
a	O
Macbook	O
to	O
this	O
Mac	O
Mini	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
upgrade!	O

Web	B-A
browsing	I-A
	O
is	O
very	O
quick	O
with	O
Safari	B-A
browser	I-A
.	O

It	O
couldn't	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
better	O
decision.	O

I	O
like	O
the	O
lighted	B-A
screen	I-A
	O
at	O
night.	O

It's	O
great	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
solid	O
Mac	O
in	O
the	O
living	O
room.	O

It	O
is	O
really	O
easy	O
to	O
use	B-A
	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
quick	O
to	O
start	B-A
up	I-A
.	O

I've	O
lived	O
with	O
the	O
crashes	O
and	O
slow	O
operation	B-A
	O
and	O
restarts.	O

Very	O
light	O
and	O
easily	O
maneuverable.	O

USB3	B-A
Peripherals	I-A
	O
are	O
noticably	O
less	O
expensive	O
than	O
the	O
ThunderBolt	B-A
	O
ones.	O

This	O
can	O
be	O
annoying	O
at	O
first	O
but	O
you	O
just	O
have	O
to	O
train	O
yourself	O
not	O
to	O
to	O
start	O
over	O
so	O
far.	O

And	O
mine	O
had	O
broke	O
but	O
I	O
sent	O
it	O
in	O
under	O
warranty	B-A
-no	O
problems.	O

I	O
am	O
not	O
happy	O
with	O
my	O
purchase	O

It's	O
fast,	O
light,	O
and	O
is	O
perfect	O
for	O
media	B-A
editing	I-A
,	O
which	O
is	O
mostly	O
why	O
I	O
bought	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
place.	O

However,	O
the	O
machine	O
itself	O
left	O
a	O
bit	O
to	O
be	O
desired.	O

The	O
battery	B-A
	O
lasts	O
as	O
advertised	O
(give	O
or	O
take	O
15-20	O
minutes),	O
and	O
the	O
entire	O
user	B-A
experience	I-A
	O
is	O
very	O
elegant.	O

I	O
spent	O
months	O
looking	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
laptop	O
for	O
me	O
and	O
I	O
finally	O
found	O
it!	O

$999.00	O
Tax	O
free.	O

Thanks	O
for	O
the	O
fast	O
shipment	B-A
	O
and	O
great	O

!Excelent	O
performance	B-A

,	O
presentation	B-A
	O
and	O
time	B-A
response	I-A
.	O

The	O
smaller	O
size	B-A
	O
was	O
a	O
bonus	O
because	O
of	O
space	O
restrictions.	O

I	O
blame	O
the	O
Mac	B-A
OS	I-A
.	O

But	O
for	O
now,	O
this	O
laptop	O
is	O
still	O
a	O
workhorse.	O

In	O
fact	O
I	O
still	O
use	O
manyLegacy	B-A
programs	I-A
	O
(Appleworks	B-A
,	O
FileMaker	B-A
Pro	I-A
,	O
Quicken	B-A
,	O
Photoshop	B-A
	O
etc)!	O

It's	O
small	O
but	O
powerful,	O
light	O
but	O
strong,	O
elegant	O
and	O
beautiful...	O
In	O
resume:	O
it's	O
a	O
Mac!	O

I	O
like	O
the	O
operating	B-A
system	I-A
.	O

I	O
wish	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
taken	O
the	O
plunge	O
years	O
ago.	O

I	O
love	O
the	O
form	B-A
factor	I-A
.	O

I	O
haven't	O
used	O
the	O
product	O
long	O
enough	O
to	O
write	O
a	O
detailed	O
technical	O
review.	O

It's	O
fast	O
at	O
loading	B-A
the	I-A
internet	I-A
.	O

So	O
much	O
faster	O
and	O
sleeker	O
looking	B-A
.	O

I	O
plan	O
on	O
using	O
my	O
MacBook	O
Pro	O
for	O
a	O
long	O
time.	O

Unfortunately,	O
it	O
runs	O
XP	B-A
	O
and	O
Microsoft	O
is	O
dropping	O
support	B-A
	O
next	O
April.	O

Its	O
seen	O
in	O
movies,	O
sitcoms,	O
prominent	O
important	O
people	O
carry	O
and	O
use	O
them	O
and	O
they	O
are	O
GREAT!	O

First	O
off,	O
I	O
really	O
do	O
like	O
my	O
MBP...	O
once	O
used	O
to	O
the	O
OS	B-A
	O
it	O
is	O
pretty	O
easy	O
to	O
get	O
around,	O
and	O
the	O
overall	B-A
build	I-A
	O
is	O
great...	O
eg	O
the	O
keyboard	B-A
	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O

Buy	O
the	O
Mac	O
Mini	O
it's	O
a	O
terribly	O
great	O
machine.	O

It	O
is	O
made	O
of	O
such	O
solid	O
construction	B-A
	O
and	O
since	O
I	O
have	O
never	O
had	O
a	O
Mac	O
using	O
my	O
iPhone	O
helped	O
me	O
get	O
used	O
to	O
the	O
system	B-A
	O
a	O
bit.	O

I	O
love	O
this	O
piece	O
of	O

It	O
will	O
be	O
hard	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
other	O
type	O
of	O
laptop	O
after	O
using	O
a	O
MacBook	O
Pro.	O

Very	O
nice	O
unibody	B-A
construction	I-A
.	O

Very	O
disappointed	O
with	O
Apple.	O

This	O
Macbook	O
Pro	O
is	O
fast,	O
powerful,	O
and	O
runs	B-A
	O
super	O
quiet	O
and	O
cool.	O

***The	O
review	O
below	O
is	O
no	O
longer	O
relevant,	O
Apple	O
has	O
fixed	O
the	O
issue.	O

It's	O
ok	O
but	O
doesn't	O
have	O
a	O
disk	B-A
drive	I-A
	O
which	O
I	O
didn't	O
know	O
until	O
after	O
I	O
bought	O
it.	O

There	O
is	O
no	O
HDMI	B-A
receptacle	I-A
,	O
nor	O
is	O
there	O
an	O
SD	B-A
card	I-A
slot	I-A
	O
located	O
anywhere	O
on	O
the	O
device.	O

It	O
really	O
is	O
very	O
light	O
compared	O
to	O
other	O
computers.	O

It	O
came	O
in	O
brand	O
new	O
and	O
works	B-A
	O
perfectly.	O

This	O
machine	O
is	O
A-mazing.	O

It	O
shouldn't	O
happen	O
like	O
that,	O
I	O
don't	O
have	O
any	O
design	B-A
app	I-A
	O
open	O
or	O
anything.	O

MY	O
TRACKPAD	B-A
	O
IS	O
NOT	O
WORKING.	O

I	O
just	O
hope	O
this	O
expensive	O
laptop	O
doesn't	O
go	O
dead	O
like	O
my	O
friends...it	O
did	O
last	O
him	O
5	O
good	O
years	O
before	O
it	O
bit	O
the	O
dust.	O

Considering	O
another	O
computer	O
should	O
be	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
question	O

It	O
looks	B-A
	O
and	O
feels	B-A
	O
solid,	O
with	O
a	O
flawless	O
finish	B-A
.	O

Its	O
worth	O
every	O
Penny.	O

Price	B-A
	O
was	O
higher	O
when	O
purchased	O
on	O
MAC	O
when	O
compared	O
to	O
price	B-A
	O
showing	O
on	O
PC	O
when	O
I	O
bought	O
this	O
product.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
for	O
a	O
decked	O
out	O
MacBook	O
Pro.	O

Then	O
the	O
system	B-A
	O
would	O
many	O
times	O
not	O
power	B-A
down	I-A
	O
without	O
a	O
forced	O
power-off.	O

Get	O
this	O
instead,	O
you	O
won't	O
be	O
sorry.	O

The	O
configuration	B-A
	O
is	O
perfect	O
for	O
my	O
needs.	O

and	O
the	O
speakers	B-A
	O
is	O
the	O
worst	O
ever.	O

I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
around	O
16	O
hundred	O
bucks	O
last	O
I	O
checked.	O

Its	O
the	O
best,	O
its	O
got	O
the	O
looks	B-A
,	O
super	O
easy	O
to	O
use	B-A
	O
and	O
love	O
all	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
with	O
the	O
trackpad	B-A
!..	O

It's	O
fast,	O
quiet,	O
incredibly	O
small	O
and	O
affordable	O
compared	O
to	O
other	O
Mac	O
models.	O

Web	B-A
surfuring	I-A
	O
is	O
smooth	O
and	O
seamless.	O

It	O
was	O
so	O
exciting	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
unwrapp	O
my	O
new	O
mac.	O

I'm	O
overall	O
pleased	O
with	O
the	O
interface	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
portability	B-A
	O
of	O
this	O
product.	O

so	O
when	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
money	O
to	O
buy	O
one	O
I	O
bought	O
other	O
things	O
instead....a	O
700	O
laptop	O
and	O
some	O
extra	O
stuff	O
with	O
it.	O

This	O
item	O
is	O
a	O
beautiful	O
piece,	O
it	O
works	B-A
	O
well,	O
it	O
is	O
easy	O
to	O
carry	B-A
	O
and	O
handle	B-A
.	O

See	O
retired	O
recently	O
and	O
decided	O
that	O
she	O
wanted	O
a	O
laptop.	O

It	O
was	O
also	O
suffering	O
from	O
hardware	B-A
(keyboard)	I-A
	O
issues,	O
relatively	O
slow	O
performance	B-A
	O
and	O
shortening	O
battery	B-A
lifetime	I-A
.	O

I'm	O
no	O
regular	O
customer	O
I	O
hate	O
wasting	O
my	O
time	O
with	O
hellos	O
and	O
how	O
can	O
I	O
help	O
you's.	O

Runs	B-A
	O
good	O
and	O
does	O
the	O
job,	O
can't	O
complain	O
about	O
that!	O

It's	O
silent	O
and	O
has	O
a	O
very	O
small	O
footprint	B-A
	O
on	O
my	O
desk.	O

I	O
have	O
nothing	O
to	O
regret	O
from	O
this	O
new	O
product.	O

The	O
exterior	B-A
	O
is	O
absolutely	O
gorgeous.	O

Have	O
one	O
myself	O
and	O
Love	O
it!	O

It	O
has	O
a	O
very	O
high	O
performance	B-A
,	O
just	O
for	O
what	O
I	O
needed	O
for.	O

This	O
is	O
especially	O
disheartening	O
when	O
Apple	O
prides	O
itself	O
as	O
the	O
choice	O
of	O
creative	O
professionals.	O

Apple	O
is	O
aware	O
of	O
this	O
issue	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
either	O
old	O
stock	O
or	O
a	O
defective	O
design	B-A
	O
involving	O
the	O
intel	B-A
4000	I-A
graphics	I-A

.	O

Stop	O
living	O
in	O
the	O
stone	O
age	O
and	O
buy	O
a	O
mac,	O
you	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
sorry	O
at	O
all!!	O

OSX	B-A
Mountain	I-A
Lion	I-A
	O
	O
soon	O
to	O
upgrade	O
to	O
Mavericks	B-A
.	O

Apple	O
hit	O
a	O
home	O
run	O
here.	O

I	O
just	O
bought	O
the	O
new	O
MacBook	O
Pro,	O
the	O
13"	O
model,	O
and	O
I	O
can't	O
believe	O
Apple	O
keeps	O
making	O
the	O
same	O
mistake	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
USB	B-A
ports	I-A
.	O

So	O
glad	O
I	O
have	O
gone	O
this	O
route!!	O

It	O
wakes	B-A
	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
a	O
second	O
when	O
I	O
open	O
the	O
lid	B-A
.	O

It	O
is	O
the	O
perfect	O
size	B-A
	O
and	O
speed	B-A
	O
for	O
me.	O

I	O
am	O
so	O
addict	O
to	O
this	O
laptop.	O

THE	O
CUSTOMER	B-A
SERVICE	I-A
	O
IS	O
TERRIFIC!!	O

Trashed	O
it	O
when	O
I	O
spilled	O
a	O
latte	O
on	O
it	O
while	O
writing	O
at	O
a	O
cafe.	O

My	O
last	O
laptop	O
was	O
a	O
17"	O
ASUS	O
gaming	O
machine,	O
which	O
performed	B-A
	O
admirably,	O
but	O
having	O
since	O
built	O
my	O
own	O
desktop	O
and	O
really	O
settling	O
into	O
the	O
college	O
life,	O
I	O
found	O
myself	O
wanting	O
something	O
smaller	O
and	O
less	O
cumbersome,	O
not	O
to	O
mention	O
that	O
the	O
ASUS	O
had	O
been	O
slowly	O
developing	O
problems	O
ever	O
since	O
I	O
bought	O
it	O
about	O
4	O
years	O
ago.	O

However,	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
have	O
any	O
scratches,	O
ZERO	O
battery	B-A
cycle	I-A
count	I-A
	O
(pretty	O
surprised),	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
hardware	B-A
	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
working	O
perfectly.	O

After	O
fumbling	O
around	O
with	O
the	O
OS	B-A
	O
I	O
started	O
searching	O
the	O
internet	O
for	O
a	O
fix	O
and	O
found	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
forums	O
on	O
fixing	O
the	O
issue.	O

I	O
couldn't	O
be	O
more	O
pleased.	O

And	O
as	O
for	O
all	O
the	O
fancy	O
finger	B-A
swipes	I-A
	O
--	O
I	O
just	O
gave	O
up	O
and	O
attached	O
a	O
mouse	B-A
.	O

I	O
needed	O
a	O
laptop	O
with	O
big	O
storage	B-A
,	O
a	O
nice	O
screen	B-A
	O
and	O
fast	O
so	O
I	O
can	O
photoshop	B-A
	O
without	O
any	O
problem.	O

I	O
like	O
coming	O
back	O
to	O
Mac	B-A
OS	I-A
	O
but	O
this	O
laptop	O
is	O
lacking	O
in	O
speaker	B-A
quality	I-A
	O
compared	O
to	O
my	O
$400	O
	O
old	O
HP	O
laptop.	O

It	O
is	O
much	O
better	O
than	O
the	O
Acer	O
ultrabook	O
I	O
had	O
before.	O

Shipped	B-A
	O
very	O
quickly	O
and	O
safely.	O

I	O
finally	O
own	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
computing	O
equipment	O
that	O
I	O
don't	O
want	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
baseball	O
bat	O
and	O
destroy.	O

The	O
thunderbolt	B-A
port	I-A
	O
is	O
awesome!	O

User	O
friendly,	O
fast	O
and	O
high	O
tech	O
It	O
is	O
amazing!	O

The	O
performance	B-A
	O
is	O
definitely	O
superior	O
to	O
any	O
computer	O
I've	O
ever	O
put	O
my	O
hands	O
on.	O

It's	O
great	O
for	O
streaming	B-A
video	I-A
	O
and	O
other	O
entertainment	B-A
uses	I-A
.	O

Apple	O
did	O
a	O
great	O
job.	O

I	O
like	O
the	O
design	B-A
	O
and	O
its	O
features	B-A
	O
but	O
there	O
are	O
somethings	O
I	O
think	O
needs	O
to	O
be	O
improved.	O

There	O
were	O
small	O
problems	O
with	O
Mac	B-A
office	I-A
.	O

It	O
is	O
extremely	O
fast	O
and	O
very	O
compact.	O

I	O
understand	O
I	O
should	O
call	O
Apple	B-A
Tech	I-A
Support	I-A
	O
about	O
any	O
variables(which	O
is	O
my	O

as	O

could	O
be	O
a	O
bigger	O

I	O
ordered	O
my	O
2012	O

after	O
being	O
disappointed	O
with	O
spec	B-A
	O
of	O
the	O
new	O

Imacs.	O

It	O
still	O
works	B-A
	O
and	O
it's	O
extremely	O
user	O
friendly,	O
so	O
I	O
would	O
recommend	O
it	O
for	O
new	O
computer	O
user	O
and	O
also	O
for	O
those	O
who	O
are	O
just	O
looking	O
for	O
a	O
more	O
efficient	O
way	O
to	O
do	O

Its	O
fast,	O
easy	O
to	O
use	B-A
	O
and	O
it	O
looks	B-A
	O
great.	O

(but	O
Office	B-A
	O
can	O
be	O
purchased)	O
IF	O
I	O
ever	O
need	O
a	O
laptop	O
again	O
I	O
am	O
for	O
sure	O
purchasing	O
another	O
Toshiba!!	O

I	O
haven't	O
tried	O
the	O
one	O
with	O
retina	B-A
display	I-A
...	O
Maybe	O
in	O
the	O
future.	O

You	O
can	O
read	O
all	O
about	O
the	O
details	O
of	O
this	O
marvelous	O
computer	O
on	O
wikipedia.	O

Performance	B-A
	O
is	O
much	O
much	O
better	O
on	O
the	O
Pro,	O
especially	O
if	O
you	O
install	O
an	O
SSD	B-A
	O
on	O
it.	O

Note,	O
however,	O
that	O
any	O
existing	O
MagSafe	B-A
accessories	I-A
	O
you	O
have	O
will	O
not	O
work	O
with	O
the	O
MagSafe	B-A

If	O
you	O
get	O
a	O
lemon	O
(I	O
have	O
two	O
thirds	O
of	O
my	O
Macs),	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
send	O
it	O
in	O
for	O
repairs	O
several	O
times	O
before	O
they	O
will	O
replace	O
it,	O
even	O
if	O
they	O
have	O
numerous	O
problems	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
version	O
of	O
their	O
computers.	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
I	O
dislike	O
is	O
the	O
touchpad	B-A
,	O
alot	O
of	O
the	O
times	O
its	O
unresponsive	O
and	O
does	O
things	O
I	O
dont	O
want	O
it	O
too,	O
I	O
would	O
recommend	O
using	O
a	O
mouse	B-A
	O
with	O
it.	O

Yeah,	O
it's	O
super	O
expensive.	O

The	O
Mac	O
mini	O
is	O
about	O
8x	O
smaller	O
than	O
my	O
old	O
computer	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
huge	O
bonus	O
and	O
runs	B-A
	O
very	O
quiet,	O
actually	O
the	O
fans	B-A
	O
aren't	O
audible	O
unlike	O
my	O
old	O

MAYBE	O
The	O
Mac	B-A
OS	I-A
	O
improvement	O
were	O
not	O
The	O
product	O
they	O
Want	O
to	O
offer.	O

It	O
came	O
before	O
the	O
day	O
it	O
supposed	O
to	O
which	O
is	O
great.	O

I	O
thought	O
the	O
transition	O
would	O
be	O
difficult	O
at	O
best	O
and	O
would	O
take	O
some	O
time	O
to	O
fully	O
familiarize	O
myself	O
with	O
the	O
new	O
Mac	B-A
ecosystem	I-A
.	O

It's	O
absolutely	O
wonderful	O
and	O
worth	O
the	O
price	B-A
!	O

It's	O
a	O
good	O
fix,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion.	O

I	O
am	O
please	O
with	O
the	O

Buying	O
a	O
Mac	O

would	O
allow	O
me	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
transition.	O

Before	O
I	O
begin,	O
I	O
will	O
say	O
that	O
I	O

not	O

a	O

its	O
by	O

more	O
stable	O

my	O

I	O
purchased	O

Moving	O

I	O

I	O

I	O

I	O

that	O
was	O
a	O

The	O

is	O
fast	O

everything	O

it's	O

It	O

for	O
a	O
new	O
laptop,	O
but	O
was	O
sent	O
a	O
used	O
one.	O

Searched	O
it	O
on	O
amazon	O
and	O
on	O
bestbuy.	O

I	O
bought	O
this	O
one	O
for	O
my	O
11	O
year	O
old	O
and	O
the	O
MacBook	O
Air	O
for	O
my	O
9	O
year	O
old.	O

I	O
bought	O
it	O
for	O
college	O
and	O
so	O
far	O
it's	O
amazing!	O

They	O
are	O
simpler	O
to	O
use	B-A
.	O

It	O
was	O
at	O
my	O
door	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
24	O
hours.	O

It's	O
also	O
very	O
pricey	O
but	O
you	O
just	O
have	O
to	O
tell	O
yourself	O
it's	O
an	O
investment	O
and	O
that	O
it's	O
gonna	O
last	O
you	O
a	O
long	O
time.	O

It	O
was	O
getting	O
old	O
and	O
I	O
needed	O
a	O
new	O
school	O
computer.	O

!so	O
nice	O
..	O
stable	O
..	O
fast	O
..	O
now	O
i	O
got	O
my	O
SSD	B-A
	O
!	O

I	O
love	O
apple	O
but	O
unlike	O
others	O
That	O
does	O
not	O
prevent	O
me	O
to	O
not	O
be	O
honest	O
about	O
how	O
i	O
like	O
it	O
and	O
if	O
its	O
good	O
or	O
not.	O

So,	O
I'm	O
cooled	O
on	O
Mac	O
buys.	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
computer	O
for	O
that	O
and	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
I'm	O
happy	O
I	O
switched.	O

Also,	O
in	O
using	O
the	O
built-in	B-A
camera	I-A
,	O
my	O
voice	B-A
recording	I-A
	O
for	O
my	O
vlog	O
sounds	O
like	O
the	O
interplanetary	O
transmissions	O
in	O
the	O
"Star	O
Wars"	O
saga.	O

Overall	O
a	O
nice	O
computer.	O

You	O
can	O
imagine	O
that	O
an	O
expensive	O
item	O
as	O
a	O
laptop	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
left	O
on	O
your	O
front	O
steps,	O
it	O
needs	O
signature	O
to	O
pove	O
that	O
you	O
received	O
it.	O

I	O
love	O
the	O
quick	O
start	B-A
up	I-A
.	O

Yes,	O
he	O
is	O
a	O
self	O
professed	O
"Mac	O
snob.	O

You	O
just	O
cannot	O
beat	O
the	O
functionality	B-A
	O
of	O
an	O
Apple	O
device.	O

Yet	O
my	O
mac	O
continues	O
to	O
function	B-A
	O
properly.	O

Graphics	B-A
	O
are	O
much	O
improved.	O

Here	O
are	O
the	O
things	O
that	O
made	O
me	O
confident	O
with	O
my	O
purchase:Build	B-A
Quality	I-A
	O
-	O
Seriously,	O
you	O
can't	O
beat	O
a	O
unibody	B-A
construction	I-A
.	O

It's	O
the	O
mid	O
2012	O
version.	O

It	O
provides	O
much	O
more	O
flexibility	B-A
for	I-A
connectivity	I-A
.	O

I	O
want	O
the	O
portability	B-A
	O
of	O
a	O
tablet,	O
without	O
the	O
limitations	O
of	O
a	O
tablet	O
and	O
that's	O
where	O
this	O
laptop	O
comes	O
into	O
play.	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
many,	O
many	O
issues	O
with	O
PC's	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
and	O
I'm	O
finally	O
glad	O
to	O
have	O
joined	O
the	O
Mac	O
revolution!	O

Mac	B-A
tutorials	I-A
	O
do	O
help.	O

When	O
it	O
broke	O
I	O
wanted	O
another	O
Acer	O
and	O
chose	O
the	O
V5.	O

The	O
technical	B-A
support	I-A
	O
was	O
not	O
helpful	O
as	O
well.	O

I	O
got	O
the	O
new	O
adapter	B-A
	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
change.	O

so	O
i	O
called	O
technical	B-A
support	I-A
.	O

Nothing	O
about	O
it	O
that	O
i	O
don't	O
love,	O
apple	O
always	O
makes	O
a	O
great	O
product.	O

I	O
saved	O
about	O
$100	O
plus	O
tax	O
ordering	O
on	O
Amazon	O
and	O
since	O
I	O
have	O
prime,	O
it	O
arrived	O
overnight	O
for	O
just	O
$3.99	O
more.	O

Came	O
with	O
iPhoto	B-A
	O
and	O
garage	B-A
band	I-A
	O
already	O
loaded.	O

It's	O
all	O
a	O
bit	O
magical.	O

Logic	B-A
board	I-A
	O
utterly	O
fried,	O
cried,	O
and	O
laid	O
down	O
and	O
died.	O

It	O
is	O
BLAZING	O
fast!	O

The	O
sound	B-A
	O
was	O
crappy	O
even	O
when	O
you	O
turn	O
up	O
the	O
volume	B-A
	O
still	O
the	O
same	O
results.	O

ive	O
never	O
had	O
a	O
problem	O
with	O
it!	O

I	O
currently	O
own	O
a	O
Lenovo	O
laptop	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
my	O
new	O
MacBook	O
Pro,	O
and	O
each	O
have	O
their	O
own	O
strengths	O

OSX	B-A

a	O
great	O

fast	O

reliable.	O

Best	O

I	O
have	O
ever	O
owned.	O

What	O
can	O
I	O
say,	O
It's	O
an	O
Apple.	O

Having	O
heard	O
from	O
friends	O
and	O
family	O
about	O
how	O
reliable	O
a	O

is,	O
I	O
never	O
expected	O
to	O
have	O
an	O

	O
crash	O
within	O
the	O
first	O

but	O
I	O
did.	O

The	O
Macbook	O

physical	B-A
form	I-A
	O
is	O
wonderful.	O

I	O
have	O
an	O
iPhone,	O
and	O
iPad,	O
so	O
it	O
just	O
made	O
sense	O
to	O
finish	O
off	O
the	O
platform	O
by	O
adding	O
the	O
Mini.	O

Not	O
super	O
light	O
but	O
still	O
a	O
good	O
one.	O

The	O
Mini's	O
body	B-A
	O
hasn't	O
changed	O
since	O
late	O
2010-	O
and	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
reason.	O

The	O
unibody	B-A
construction	I-A
	O
really	O
does	O
feel	O
lot	O
more	O
solid	O
than	O
Apple's	O
previous	O
laptops.	O

i	O
had	O
to	O
return	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
replacement.	O

It	O
was	O
wonderful	O
deal	O
for	O
the	O
wonderful	O

It	O
completely	O

my	O
home	O

Put	O
a	O
cover	B-A
	O
on	O
it	O
and	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
better	O
but	O
that	O
is	O
my	O
only	O
complaint.	O

Within	O
a	O
few	O
hours	O
I	O
was	O
using	O
the	O
gestures	B-A
	O
unconsciously.	O

This	O
mac	O
does	O
come	O
with	O
an	O
extender	B-A
cable	I-A
	O
and	O
I'm	O
using	O
mine	O
right	O
now	O
hoping	O
the	O
cable	B-A
	O
will	O
stay	O
nice	O
for	O
the	O
many	O
years	O
I	O
plan	O
on	O
using	O
this	O
mac.	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
third	O
in	O
a	O
series	O
of	O
MacBooks	O
starting	O
with	O
a	O
Black	O
MacBook.	O

The	O
2.9ghz	B-A
dual-core	I-A
i7	I-A
chip	I-A
	O
really	O
out	O
does	O
itself.	O

My	O
life	O
has	O
been	O
enriched	O
since	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
using	O
Apple	O
products.	O

i	O
FINALLY	O
DID	O
IT	O
AND	O
THIS	O
MACHINE	O
IS	O
THE	O
WAY	O
TO	O
GO!	O

It	O
is	O
pretty	O
snappy	O
and	O
starts	B-A
up	I-A
	O
in	O
about	O
30	O
seconds	O
which	O
is	O
good	O
enough	O
for	O
me.	O

The	O
few	O
things	O
that	O
are	O
wrong	O
with	O
it	O
are	O
very	O
minor	O
things.	O

So	O
noise	B-A
	O
is	O
reduced	O
at	O
least	O
50%	O
and	O
the	O
heat	B-A
	O
is	O
much	O
better,	O
now	O
it	O
doesn't	O
feel	O
hot	O
but	O
warm.	O

Not	O
sure	O
on	O
Windows	B-A
8	I-A
.	O

It's	O
a	O
lottery	O
at	O
this	O
point	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
read	O
that	O
other	O
have	O
received	O
new	O
ones	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
problem.	O

My	O
one	O
complaint	O
is	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
internal	B-A
CD	I-A
drive	I-A
.	O

This	O
newer	O
netbook	O
has	O
no	O
hard	B-A
drive	I-A
	O
or	O
network	B-A
lights	I-A
.	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
use	O
a	O
Mac	O
and	O
I'm	O
really	O
happy	O
with	O
the	O
move.	O

No	O
complaints	O
for	O
an	O
Apple	O
product.	O

The	O
new	O
MacBook	O
is	O
lightyears	O
ahead	O
of	O
my	O
old	O
white	O
plastic	O
MacBook	O
circa	O
2006.	O

I	O
would	O
say	O
that	O
85%	O
of	O
the	O
design	O
industry	O
is	O
Mac	O
for	O
good	O
reason.	O

I	O
was	O
having	O
a	O
though	O
time	O
deciding	O
between	O
the	O
13"	O
MacBook	O
Air	O
or	O
the	O
MacBook	O
Pro	O
13"	O
(Both	O
baseline	O
models,	O
priced	B-A
	O
at	O
1,200	O
$	O
retail)	O

The	O
last	O
new	O
mac	O
I	O
bought	O
was	O
in	O
1998.	O

There	O
are	O
reviews	O
that	O
speak	O
to	O
a	O
few	O
possible	O
glitches	O
but,	O
I	O
haven't	O
seen	O
them	O
yet.	O

Not	O
too	O
expense	O
and	O
has	O
enough	O
storage	B-A
	O
for	O
most	O
users	O
and	O
many	O
ports	B-A
.	O

I	O
am	O
very	O
satisfied	O
with	O
the	O
mini.	O

The	O
audio	B-A
volume	I-A
	O
is	O
quite	O
low	O
and	O
virtually	O
unusable	O
in	O
a	O
room	O
with	O
any	O
background	O
activity.	O

I	O
am	O
going	O
to	O
college	O
next	O
year	O
and	O
I	O
needed	O
a	O
cheaper,	O
quality	O
computer	O
for	O
the	O
goals	O
I	O
am	O
trying	O
to	O
pursue.	O

In	O
the	O
short	O
time	O
of	O
one	O
month	O
since	O
the	O
2012	O
Mac	O
Mini	O
was	O
released	O
there	O
are	O
well	O
over	O
1000	O
posts	O
regarding	O
this	O
issue	O
and	O
the	O
numbers	O
keep	O
rising.	O

It	O
is	O
lightweight	O
and	O
the	O
perfect	O
size	B-A
	O
to	O
carry	O
to	O

If	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
ask	O
you	O
don't	O
own	O
a	O

and	O
your	O

I	O
don't	O
know	O
why	O
I	O
didn't	O
make	O
the	O
switch	O
sooner...o	O
ya	O
because	O
it's	O
expensive.	O

I	O
was	O
given	O
a	O
demonstration	O
of	O
Windows	B-A
8	I-A
.	O

The	O
Macbook	O
Pro	O
is	O
the	O
premier	O
choice	O
for	O
college	O
students.	O

Their	O
products,	O
including	O
the	O
MBP,	O
are	O
beautiful,	O
sleek	O
and	O
clever.	O

The	O
MBP	O
is	O
beautiful	O
has	O
many	O
wonderful	O
capabilities	B-A
.	O

I	O
thought	O
that	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
fine,	O
if	O
i	O
do	O
some	O
settings	B-A
.	O

Runs	B-A
	O
very	O
smoothly.	O

Perfect--thanks	O
so.	O

Also,	O
it	O
hardly	O
ever	O
crashes.	O

I	O
was	O
so	O
excited	O
to	O
get	O
this	O
in	O
the	O
mail	O
i	O
nearly	O
gave	O
myself	O
a	O
heart	O
attack.	O

Boot-up	B-A
	O
slowed	O
significantly	O
after	O
all	O
Windows	B-A
updates	I-A
	O
were	O
installed.	O

More	O
likely	O
it	O
will	O
require	O
replacing	O
the	O
logic	B-A
board	I-A
	O
once	O
they	O
admit	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
problem	O
and	O
come	O
up	O
with	O
a	O
solution.	O

When	O
i	O
finally	O
held	O
it	O
in	O
my	O
hands	O
i	O
kissed	O
it,	O
yes	O
i	O
did.	O

It	O
was	O
important	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
powerful	O
enough	O
to	O

I	O

wow	O
the	O
new	O
macbook	O
pro	O
hanged	O
as	O
i	O
tried	O
to	O
type	O
this	O
review.	O

The	O
MacBook	O
Pro	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
product	O
which	O
can	O
meet	O
the	O
needs	O
of	O
the	O
average	O
consumer.	O

I	O
was	O
concerned	O
that	O
the	O
downgrade	O
to	O
the	O
regular	B-A
hard	I-A
drive	I-A
	O
would	O
make	O
it	O
unacceptably	O
slow	O
but	O
I	O
need	O
not	O
have	O
worried	O
-	O
this	O
machine	O
is	O
the	O
fastest	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
owned...	O

This	O
one	O
still	O
has	O
the	O
CD	B-A
slot	I-A
.	O

No	O
HDMI	B-A
port	I-A
.	O

I	O
had	O
to	O
install	B-A
Mountain	I-A
Lion	I-A
	O
and	O
it	O
took	O
a	O
good	O
two	O
hours.	O

Customization	B-A
	O
on	O
mac	O
is	O
impossible.	O

I	O
hope	O
this	O
review	O
helps.	O

However,	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
adjust	O
yourself	O
to	O
what	O
it	O
will	O
do,	O
not	O
what	O
you	O
want	O
it	O
to	O
do.	O

I	O
am	O
replacing	O
the	O
HD	B-A
	O
with	O
a	O
Micron	B-A
SSD	I-A
	O
soon.	O

Plus	O
two	B-A
finger	I-A
clicking	I-A
	O
as	O
a	O
replacement	O
for	O
the	O
right	B-A
click	I-A
button	I-A
	O
is	O
surprisingly	O
intuitive.	O

Far	O
superior	O
to	O
my	O
MacBook.	O

The	O
SuperDrive	B-A
	O
is	O
quiet.	O

It	O
was	O
quite	O
easy.	O

The	O
power	B-A
plug	I-A
	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
connected	O
to	O
the	O
power	B-A
adaptor	I-A
	O
to	O
charge	O
the	O
battery	B-A
	O
but	O
won't	O
stay	O
connected.	O

I	O
decided	O
to	O
buy	O
a	O
few	O
notebooks	O
for	O
my	O
nephews	O
for	O
Xmas.	O

The	O
battery	B-A
	O
was	O
completely	O
dead,	O
in	O
fact	O
it	O
had	O
grown	O
about	O
a	O
quarter	O
inch	O
thick	O
lump	O
on	O
the	O
underside.	O

This	O
is	O
no	O
exception.	O

if	O
yo	O
like	O
practicality	B-A
	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
laptop	O
for	O
you.	O

The	O
OS	B-A
	O
is	O
great.	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
a	O
black	O
macbook	O
since	O
2007.	O

I	O
tried	O
several	O
monitors	B-A
	O
and	O
several	O
HDMI	B-A
cables	I-A
	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
case	O
each	O
time.	O

CONS:	O
Price	B-A
	O
is	O
a	O
bit	O
ridiculous,	O
kinda	O
heavy.	O

If	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
case,	O
then	O
I	O
am	O
completely	O
happy	O

10/10	O
five	O
stars	O
would	O
recommend.	O

The	O
troubleshooting	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
AC	B-A
adaptor	I-A
	O
so	O
we	O
ordered	O
a	O
new	O
one.	O

I	O
fell	O
in	O
love	O
with	O
my	O
machine,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
pampered.	O

Fan	B-A
	O
only	O
comes	O
on	O
when	O
you	O
are	O
playing	B-A
a	I-A
game	I-A
.	O

Which	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
have,	O
only	O
3	O
USB	B-A
2	I-A
ports	I-A
.	O

No	O
startup	B-A
disk	I-A
	O
was	O
not	O
included	O
but	O
that	O
may	O
be	O
my	O
fault.	O

There	O
is	O
no	O
"tools"	B-A
menu	I-A
.	O

It	O
is	O
very	O
fast	O
and	O
has	O
everything	O
that	O
I	O
need	O
except	O
for	O
a	O
word	B-A
program	I-A
.	O

Needs	O
a	O
CD/DVD	B-A
drive	I-A
	O
and	O
a	O
bigger	O
power	B-A
switch	I-A
.	O

It	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
laptop	O
ever!!!	O

My	O
laptop	O
with	O
Windows	B-A
7	I-A
	O
crashed	O
and	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
want	O
Windows	B-A
8	I-A
.	O

Was	O
skeptical	O
about	O
buying	O
an	O
electronic	O
item	O
online	O
but	O
it	O
turned	O
out	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
positive	O
experience.	O

Not	O
a	O
scratch	O
or	O
mark	O
on	O
it.	O

Easy	O
to	O
install	B-A
	O
also	O
small	O
to	O
leave	O
anywhere	O
at	O
your	O
bedroom	O
also	O
very	O
easy	O
to	O
configure	B-A
for	I-A
ADSl	I-A
cable	I-A
or	I-A
wifi	I-A
.	O

Words	O
cannot	O
express	O
how	O
much	O
I	O
love	O
my	O
new	O
Mac.	O

The	O
speakers	B-A
	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
better	O
but	O
it	O
wasn't	O
a	O
deal	O
breaker...	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
little	O
laptop...	O
love	O
it!	O

The	O
item	O
received	O
was	O
exactly	O
as	O
identified.	O

Its	O
everything	O
mac	O
offers.	O

Nice	O
packing	B-A
.	O

Besides	O
being	O
elegant,	O
the	O
MacBooks	O
are	O
durable.	O

I	O
switched	O
to	O
this	O
because	O
I	O
wanted	O
something	O
different,	O
even	O
though	O
I	O
miss	O
windows	B-A
.	O

Yes,	O
the	O
MBP	O
is	O
more	O
expensive	O
than	O
competing	O
PC	O
laptops.	O

Apple	O
no	O
longer	O
includes	O
iDVD	B-A
	O
with	O
the	O
computer	O
and	O
furthermore,	O
Apple	O
doesn't	O
even	O
offer	O
it	O
anymore!	O

I	O
also	O
wanted	O
Windows	B-A
7	I-A
,	O
which	O
this	O
one	O
has.	O

At	O
first,	O
I	O
feel	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
uncomfortable	O
in	O
using	O
the	O
Mac	B-A
system	I-A
.	O

I	O
am	O
used	O
to	O
computers	O
with	O
windows	B-A
	O
so	O
I	O
am	O
having	O
a	O
little	O
difficulty	O
finding	O
my	O
way	O
around.	O

They	O
replaced	O
it	O
and	O
so	O
far	O
so	O
good.	O

It	O
just	O
works	B-A
	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
box	O
and	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
cool	O
software	B-A
	O
included	O
with	O
the	O
OS	B-A
.	O

Good	O
in	O
every	O
aspect.	O

its	O
as	O
advertised	O
on	O
here.....	O
it	O
works	B-A
	O
great	O
and	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
waste	O
of	O
money!	O

Replaced	O
this	O
one	O
with	O
my	O
mac	O
that	O
was	O
stolen,	O
its	O
a	O
great	O
computer.	O

Just	O
be	O
careful;	O
you	O
always	O
have	O
to	O
give	O
up	O
some	O
good	O
stuff	O
for	O
others.	O

Runs	B-A
	O
like	O
a	O
champ.....	O

Really	O
great...Well	O
let	O
me	O
start	O
at	O
the	O
beginning.	O

Premium	O
price	B-A
	O
for	O
the	O
OS	B-A
	O
more	O
than	O
anything	O
else.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
gift	O
for	O
my	O
grand	O
son.	O

I	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
concerned	O
about	O
the	O
touch	B-A
pad	I-A
	O
based	O
on	O
reviews,	O
but	O
I've	O
found	O
it	O
fine	O
to	O
work	O
with.	O

I	O
bought	O
this	O
Mac	O
book	O
pro	O
along	O
with	O
a	O
new	O
27"	O
iMac	O
and	O
while	O
they	O
are	O
still	O
light	O
years	O
more	O
reliable	O
than	O
a	O
PC	O
I	O
have	O
noticed	O
a	O
decline	O
in	O
the	O
reliability	B-A
	O
of	O
my	O
Mac	O
computers.	O

The	O
sound	B-A
	O
as	O
mentioned	O
earlier	O
isn't	O
the	O
best,	O
but	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
solved	O
with	O
headphones	B-A
.	O

The	O
track	B-A
pad	I-A
	O
is	O
a	O
bit	O
squirrely	O
at	O
times-	O
sometimes	O
too	O
sensitive,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
a	O
bit	O
unresponsive,	O
but	O
it's	O
usable.	O

However,	O
the	O
experience	O
was	O
great	O
since	O
the	O
OS	B-A
	O
does	O
not	O
become	O
unstable	O
and	O
the	O
application	B-A
	O
will	O
simply	O
shutdown	O
and	O
reopen.	O

Then	O
only	O
FOUR	O
months	O
later,	O
my	O
great	O
MacBook	O
pro	O
FAILED.	O

If	O
you	O
ask	O
me,	O
for	O
this	O
price	B-A
	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
included.	O

The	O
battery	B-A
	O
is	O
not	O
as	O
shown	O
in	O
the	O
product	O
photos.	O

Even	O
though	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
gotten	O
a	O
pc	O
twice	O
the	O
speed	B-A
	O
for	O
the	O
same	O
price	B-A
	O
I	O
still	O
think	O
there's	O
nothing	O
like	O
a	O
Mac.	O

Seems	O
a	O
much	O
more	O
economical	O
way	O
to	O
get	O
into	O
Apple	O
than	O
their	O
other	O
computers.	O

Shipping	B-A
	O
was	O
quick	O
and	O
product	O
described	O
was	O
the	O
product	O
sent	O
and	O
so	O
much	O
more...	O

I'm	O
so	O
disgusted	O
that	O
I	O
wasted	O
my	O
money	O
on	O
this	O
product.	O

All	O
you	O
get	O
is	O
a	O
box	O
and	O
a	O
computer.	O

the	O
retina	B-A

one	O
time	O
in	O
the	O
3	O

i've	O
had	O
it.	O

The	O
Mac	O
Mini	O
is	O
probably	O
the	O
simplest	O
example	O
of	O
compact	B-A
computing	I-A
	O
out	O
there.	O

Instead,	O
I'll	O
focus	O
more	O
on	O
the	O
actual	O
performance	B-A
and	I-A
feature	I-A
set	I-A
of	I-A
the	I-A
hardware	I-A
	O
itself	O
so	O
you	O
can	O
make	O
an	O
educated	O
decision	O
on	O
which	O
Mac	O
to	O
buy.	O

My	O
bag	O
just	O
got	O
a	O
little	O
lighter.	O

I'm	O
Not	O
exagerating	O
when	O
I	O
say	O
this	O

is	O

It	O

This	O

Additionally,	O
there	O
is	O

a	O

it's	O

has	O
always	O
been	O
second	O
nature	O
to	O
me	O
after	O
many	O
years	O
of	O
using	O
windows	B-A
.	O

I	O
am	O
an	O
Info	O
Sys	O
major	O
in	O
college,	O
so	O
I	O
started	O
researching	O
this	O
issue	O
on	O
my	O
own.	O

Solution:	O
it	O
turned	O
out	O
to	O
be	O
pretty	O
simple.	O

With	O
the	O
softwares	B-A
	O
supporting	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
other	O
OS	B-A
	O
makes	O
it	O
much	O
better.	O

Still	O
haven't	O
solved	O
this.	O

I	O
then	O
upgraded	O
to	O
Mac	B-A
OS	I-A
X	I-A
10.8	I-A
"Mountain	I-A
Lion"	I-A
.	O

It	O
is	O
EXTREMELY	O
fast	O
and	O
never	O
lags.	O

I	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
I	O
just	O
received	O
my	O
brand	O
new	O
MacBook	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
having	O
issues.	O

I	O
was	O
considering	O
buying	O
the	O
Air,	O
but	O
in	O
reality,	O
this	O
one	O
has	O
a	O
more	O
powerful	O
performance	B-A
	O
and	O
seems	O
much	O
more	O
convenient,	O
even	O
though	O
it's	O
about	O
.20	O
inch	O
thicker	O
and	O
2	O
lbs	O
heavier.	O

At	O
home	O
and	O
the	O
office	O
it	O
gets	O
plugged	O
into	O
an	O
external	B-A
24"	I-A
LCD	I-A
screen	I-A
,	O
so	O
built	B-A
in	I-A
screen	I-A
size	I-A
	O
is	O
not	O
terribly	O
important.	O

Hopefully	O
my	O
replacement	O
is	O
brand	O
new.	O

Just	O
beware	O
no	O
DVD	B-A
slot	I-A
	O
so	O
when	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
install	B-A
software	I-A
	O
I	O
had	O
on	O
CD	O
I	O
couldn't.	O

I	O
bought	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
dedicate	O
a	O
small,	O
portable	O
laptop	O
to	O
my	O
writing	O
and	O
was	O
surprised	O
to	O
learn	O
that	O
I	O
needed	O
to	O
buy	O
a	O
word	B-A
processing	I-A
program	I-A
	O
to	O
do	O
so.	O

This	O
version	O
of	O
MacBook	O
Pro	O
runs	O
on	O
a	O
third-generation	B-A
CPU	I-A
("Ivy	I-A
Bridge")	I-A
,	O
not	O
the	O
latest	O
fourth-generation	B-A
Haswell	I-A
CPU	I-A
	O
the	O
2013	O
version	O
has.	O

Actually,	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
was	O
intimidated	O
by	O
the	O
change	O
from	O
a	O
PC.	O

No	O
Cd	B-A
Rom	I-A
	O
in	O
the	O
new	O
version	O
there's	O
no	O
way	O
I'm	O
spending	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
money	O
on	O
something	O
has	O
less	O
features	B-A
	O
than	O
the	O
older	O
version.	O

Definitely	O
worth	O
spending	O
the	O
money	O
on	O
it.	O

I	O
have	O
three	O
words:	O
Piece	O
of	O
Junk!	O

the	O
volume	B-A
	O
is	O
really	O
low	O
to	O
low	O
for	O
a	O
laptopwas	O
not	O
expectin	O
t	O
volume	B-A
	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
lowan	O
i	O
hate	O
that	O
about	O
this	O
computer	O

Fits	O
all	O
my	O
personal	O
needs.	O

I'm	O
the	O
pro-active	O
type	O
so	O
I	O
went	O
off	O
and	O
did	O
some	O
preventative	O
fixes.	O

and	O
its	O
not	O
hard	O
to	O
accidentally	O
bang	O
it	O
against	O
something	O
so	O
i	O
recommend	O
getting	O
a	O
case	B-A
	O
to	O
protect	O
it.	O

I	O
wanted	O
to	O
explore	O
what	O
the	O
Mac	O
was	O
all	O
about.	O

I	O
got	O
this	O
at	O
an	O
amazing	O
price	B-A
	O
from	O
Amazon	O
and	O
it	O
arrived	O
just	O
in	O
time.	O

Every	O
time	O
I	O
log	B-A
into	I-A
the	I-A
system	I-A
	O
after	O
a	O
few	O
hours,	O
there	O
is	O
this	O
endlessly	O
frustrating	O
process	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
through.	O

The	O
majority	O
of	O
the	O
reviews	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
for	O
the	O
13.3	O
MacBook	O
Pro	O
Model	O
#	O
MD101LL/A.	O

Put	O
a	O
SSD	B-A
	O
and	O
use	O
a	O
21"	B-A
LED	I-A
screen	I-A
,	O
this	O
set	B-A
up	I-A
	O
is	O
silky	O
smooth!	O

I	O
saw	O
the	O
bad	O
reviews	O
from	O
people	O
saying	O
to	O
buy	O
directly	O
from	O
Apple	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
concerned	O
but	O
I	O
took	O
my	O
chances	O
and	O
am	O
overly	O
impressed.	O

The	O
case	B-A
	O
is	O
now	O
slightly	O
larger	O
than	O
the	O
previous	O
generation,	O
but	O
the	O
lack	O
of	O
an	O
external	B-A
power	I-A
supply	I-A
	O
justifies	O
the	O
small	O
increase	O
in	O
size	B-A
.	O

I	O
had	O
to	O
buy	O
a	O
wireless	B-A
mouse	I-A
	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
it,	O
as	O
I	O
am	O
old	O
school	O
and	O
hate	O
the	O
pad	B-A
,	O
but	O
knew	O
that	O
before	O
I	O
bought	O
it,	O
now	O
it	O
works	B-A
	O
great,	O
need	O
to	O
get	O
adjusted	O
to	O
the	O
key	B-A
board	I-A
,	O
as	O
I	O
am	O
used	O
to	O
a	O
bigger	O
one	O
and	O
pounding.	O

When	O
considering	O
a	O
Mac,	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
total	O
cost	B-A
of	I-A
ownership	I-A
	O
and	O
not	O
just	O
the	O
initial	O
price	B-A
tag	I-A
.	O

Has	O
all	O
the	O
other	O
features	B-A
	O
I	O
wanted	O
including	O
a	O
VGA	B-A
port	I-A
,	O
HDMI	B-A
,	O
ethernet	B-A
	O
and	O
3	O
USB	B-A
ports	I-A
.	O

A	O
great	O
college	O
tool!	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
I	O
dislike	O
about	O
this	O
laptop	O
are	O
the	O
rubber	B-A
pads	I-A
	O
found	O
on	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
the	O
computer	O
for	O
grip.	O

I	O
called	O
apple	O
and	O
no	O
solution.	O

It's	O
a	O
decent	O
computer	O
for	O
the	O
price	B-A
	O
and	O
hopefully	O
it	O
will	O
last	O
a	O
long	O
time.	O

I	O
was	O
really	O
happy	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
much	O
better	O
price	B-A
	O
on	O
amazon.com	O
than	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
Mac	O
store.	O

The	O
worst	O
a	O
Mac	O
ever	O
did	O
to	O
me	O
was	O
freeze	O
up.	O

The	O
nicest	O
	O
part	O
is	O
the	O
low	O
heat	B-A
output	I-A
	O
and	O
ultra	O
quiet	O
operation	B-A
.	O

I	O
am	O
paying	O
apple	O
to	O
kill	O
my	O
self	O
and	O
my	O
wallet.	O

NO	O
STAR	O
FOR	O
THIS	O
TRASH.[...	O

I	O
will	O
upgrade	B-A
the	I-A
ram	I-A
	O
myself	O
(because	O
with	O
this	O
model	O
you	O
can	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
it)	O
later	O
on.	O

The	O
price	B-A
	O
is	O
200	O
dollars	O
down.	O

this	O
Mac	O
Mini	O
does	O
not	O
have	O
a	O
built-in	B-A
mic	I-A
,	O
and	O
it	O
would	O
seem	O
that	O
its	O
Mac	B-A
OS	I-A
10.9	I-A
	O
does	O
not	O
handle	O
external	B-A
microphones	I-A
	O
properly.	O

A	O
lot	O
of	O
features	B-A
	O
and	O
shortcuts	B-A
	O
on	O
the	O
MBP	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
never	O
exposed	O
to	O
on	O
a	O
normal	O
PC.	O

Wasn't	O
sure	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
like	O
it	O
much	O
less	O
love	O
it	O
so	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
a	O
local	O
best	O
buy	O
and	O
played	O
around	O
with	O
the	O
IOS	B-A
system	I-A
	O
on	O
a	O
Mac	O
Pro	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
totally	O
unique	O
and	O
different.	O

Quietest	O
laptop	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
owned.	O

air	O
has	O
higher	O
resolution	B-A
	O
but	O
the	O
fonts	B-A
	O
are	O
small.	O

again	O
this	O
is	O
just	O
my	O
personal	O
honest	O
opinion.	O

If	O
you	O
have	O
much	O
higher	O
expectations	O
than	O
that...	O
I	O
would	O
look	O
elsewhere.	O

working	B-A
	O
with	O
Mac	O
is	O
so	O
much	O
easier,	O
so	O
many	O
cool	O
features	B-A
.	O

I'm	O
going	O
to	O
buy	O
a	O
logitevh	O
c270.	O

Very	O
happy	O
with	O
my	O
purchase.	O

I	O
like	O
the	O

I'M	O
SO	O
HAPPY	O
WITH	O
MY	O
macbook	O

I	O
only	O
wish	O
this	O
mac	O
had	O
a	O
CD/DVD	B-A
player	I-A
	O
built	O
in.	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
I	O
miss	O
is	O
that	O
my	O
old	O
Alienware	O
laptop	O
had	O
backlit	B-A
keys	I-A
.	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
I	O
miss	O
are	O
the	O
"Home/End"	B-A
type	I-A
keys	I-A
	O
and	O
other	O
things	O
that	O
I	O
grew	O
accustomed	O
to	O
after	O
so	O
long.	O

So	O
happy	O
with	O
this	O
purchase,	O
I	O
just	O
wish	O
it	O
came	O
with	O
Microsoft	B-A
Word	I-A

It	O
is	O
more	O
than	O
enough	O
computer	O
to	O
keep	O
up	O
with	O
the	O
needs	O
of	O
a	O
high	O
school	O
student.	O

It	O
has	O
enough	O
memory	B-A
	O
and	O
speed	B-A
	O
to	O
run	O
my	O
business	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
flexibility	B-A
	O
that	O
comes	O
with	O
a	O
laptop.	O

The	O
speed	B-A
,	O
the	O
simplicity	B-A
,	O
the	O
design	B-A
..	O
it	O
is	O
lightyears	O
ahead	O
of	O
any	O
PC	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
owned.	O

I	O
love	O
everything	O
about	O
this	O
computer.	O

I	O
found	O
it	O
toughest	O
to	O
decide	O
between	O
Dell	O
ultra	O
books	O
and	O
Apple.	O

The	O
battery	B-A
life	I-A
	O
is	O
excellent,	O
the	O
display	B-A
	O
is	O
excellent,	O
and	O
downloading	B-A
apps	I-A
	O
is	O
a	O
	O
breeze.	O

The	O
screen	B-A
,	O
the	O
software	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
smoothness	O
of	O
the	O
operating	B-A
system	I-A
.	O

While	O
we	O
struggle	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
crashes	O
and	O
viruses,	O
the	O
kids	O
computers	O
stay	O
consistent	O
and	O
so	O
we	O
caved	O
in	O
and	O
bought	O
one	O
for	O
buisness!	O

I	O
don't	O
want	O
to	O
RUN	O
a	O
computer;	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
USE	O
a	O
computer.	O

i	O
have	O
dropped	O
mine	O
a	O
couple	O
times	O
with	O
only	O
a	O
slim	B-A
plastic	I-A
case	I-A
	O
covering	O
it.	O

I	O
also	O
made	O
a	O
recovery	B-A
USB	I-A

Being	O
a	O
PC	O
user	O
for	O
many	O
years	O
to	O
switch	O
to	O
a	O
Mac	O
I	O
will	O
not	O
go	O
back.	O

But	O
with	O
this	O
laptop,	O
the	O
bass	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
weak	O
and	O
the	O
sound	B-A
	O
comes	O
out	O
sounding	O
tinny.	O

I	O
do	O
admit	O
it	O
is	O
pricey	O
but	O
the	O
saying	O
is	O
really	O
true	O
with	O
this	O
MacBook	O
Pro	O
Laptop	O
(	O
You	O
get	O
what	O
you	O
pay	O
for).	O

I've	O
almost	O

bought	O
every	O

MacMinis	O
since	O
2005,	O
and	O
this	O
one	O
hasn't	O
let	O
me	O
down.	O

The	O
built	B-A
quality	I-A
	O
is	O
really	O
good,	O
I	O
was	O
so	O
Happy	O
and	O
excited	O
about	O
this	O
Product.	O

I	O
am	O
loving	O
the	O
fast	O

	O
also.	O

I	O
had	O
to	O
return	O
it	O
because	O
it	O
wouldn't	O
even	O
start.	O

Further,	O
this	O
Mac	O

has	O
a	O
sloppy	O
Bluetooth	B-A
