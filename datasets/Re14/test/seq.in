The bread is top notch as well
O B-A O O O O O
I have to say they have one of the fastest delivery times in the city
O O O O O O O O O O B-A I-A O O O
Food is always fresh and hot ready to eat
B-A O O O O O O O O
Did I mention that the coffee is OUTSTANDING
O O O O O B-A O O
Certainly not the best sushi in New York , however , it is always fresh , and the place is very clean , sterile
O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O
I trust the people at Go Sushi , it never disappoints
O O O B-A O O O O O O O
Straightforward , no surprises , very decent Japanese food
O O O O O O O B-A I-A
BEST spicy tuna roll great asian salad
O B-A I-A I-A O B-A I-A
Try the rose roll not on menu
O O B-A I-A O O B-A
I love the drinks esp lychee martini and the food is also VERY good
O O O B-A O B-A I-A O O B-A O O O O
In fact , this was not a Nicoise salad and was barely eatable
O O O O O O O B-A I-A O O O O
While theres a decent menu it shouldnt take ten minutes to get your drinks and 45 for a dessert pizza
O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O B-A I-A
Once we sailed , the topnotch food and live entertainment sold us on a unforgettable evening
O O O O O O B-A O B-A I-A O O O O O O
Our waiter was horrible so rude and disinterested
O B-A O O O O O O
The sangria s watered down
O B-A O O O
menu uneventful , small
B-A O O O
Anytime and everytime I find myself in the neighborhood I will go to Sushi Rose for fresh sushi and great portions all at a reasonable price
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O B-A O O O O B-A
Great food but the service was dreadful
O B-A O O B-A O O
The portions of the food that came out were mediocre
O B-A I-A I-A I-A O O O O O
the two waitresss looked like they had been sucking on lemons
O O B-A O O O O O O O O
From the beginning , we were met by friendly staff memebers and the convienent parking at Chelsea Piers made it easy for us to get to the boat
O O O O O O O O O B-A I-A O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and will be going back for the desserts
O O O O O O O O O O O B-A
Desserts are almost incredible my personal favorite is their Tart of the Day
B-A O O O O O O O O B-A I-A I-A I-A
I am surprised at the lower reviews because it is definitely better than other places I have tried with higher ratings
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Maybe the secret was that we went on a Sunday night and everything was great
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food was extremely tasty , creatively presented and the wine excellent
O B-A O O O O O O O O B-A O
WE ENDED UP IN LITTLE ITALY IN LATE AFTERNOON
O O O O O O O O O
WE WERE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH OUR CHOICE
O O O O O O O
THE LASAGNA WAS PROBABLY THE BEST I HAVE TASTED
O B-A O O O O O O O

You will be very happy with the experience
O O O O O O O O
The food is surprisingly good , and the decor is nice
O B-A O O O O O O B-A O O
How pretentious and inappropriate for MJ Grill to claim that it provides power lunch and dinners
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O B-A
Two wasted steaks what a crime
O O B-A O O O
The staff should be a bit more friendly
O B-A O O O O O O
I absolutely suggest this place
O O O O O
I think the meatball parm is good
O O O B-A I-A O O
If you want good tasting , well seasoned latin food eat at Cabana and you cant go wrong
O O O O O O O O B-A I-A O O O O O O O O
Definitely try the taglierini with truffles it was incredible
O O O B-A I-A I-A O O O
Also , the staff is very attentive and really personable
O O O B-A O O O O O O
Overall , this is a great new restaurant that has been consistently good every time I have been
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The gnocchi literally melts in your mouth
O B-A O O O O O
Had a great experience at Trio staff was pleasant food was tasty and large in portion size I would highly recommend the portobellogorgonzolasausage appetizer and the lobster risotto
O O O O O O B-A O O B-A O O O O O B-A I-A O O O O O B-A I-A O O B-A I-A
Entrees include classics like lasagna fettuccine Alfredo and chicken parmigiana
B-A O O O B-A B-A I-A O B-A I-A
The food is good , the teriyaki I recommend
O B-A O O O O B-A O O
Meal was very expensive for what you get
B-A O O O O O O O
Try the Peanut Butter Sorbet and the pizza with soy cheese
O O B-A I-A I-A O O B-A I-A I-A I-A
Good food at the right price what more can you ask for
O B-A O O O B-A O O O O O O
We love it , and took buses and cabs to get there
O O O O O O O O O O O O
If you re in New York , you do not want to miss this place
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food is top notch , the service is attentive , and the atmosphere is great
O B-A O O O O O B-A O O O O O B-A O O

O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O B-A I-A I-A O O O O O O B-A
My husband and I moved to Nolita 6 years ago and for as long as we have lived here , Peasant has been our favorite
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The whole experience was satisfying
O O O O O
However , it was worth the visit
O O O O O O O
The menu is interesting and quite reasonably priced
O B-A O O O O O B-A
The food was delicious and clearly fresh ingredients were used
O B-A O O O O O B-A O O
This made it obvious that the food wasnt cooked fresh it was obviously made before hand and then reheated
O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O
Appetizer are excellent here you can make a great and inexpensive meal out of them
B-A O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O
The spicy mussels are a highlight
O B-A I-A O O O
Also get the Onion Rings best weve ever had
O O O B-A I-A O O O O
Would not return for the amount we paid
O O O O O O O O
However , being foodies , we were utterly disappointed with the food
O O O O O O O O O O O B-A
Huge portions great and attentive service and pretty good prices
O B-A O O O B-A O O O B-A
I was highly disappointed by their service and food
O O O O O O B-A O B-A
I complained to the waiter and then to the manager but the intensity of rudeness from them just went up
O O O O B-A O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O
The food is great and the milkshakes are even better
O B-A O O O O B-A O O O
Stay away if youre claustrophobic
O O O O O
If youre in the hood , definitely stop in
O O O O O O O O O
the mushroom barley soup is amazing
O B-A I-A I-A O O
On the recommendation of a friend , I checked out Arezzo with my wife
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Im glad I did as the food was very good and the staff was friendly , courteous and efficient
O O O O O O B-A O O O O O B-A O O O O O O
Their duck here is also absolutely delicious
O B-A O O O O O
This is definitely one of the places that I have continued to come back to over the years
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While it was large and a bit noisy , the drinks were fantastic , and the food was superb
O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O B-A O O
One caveat Some of the curried casseroles can be a trifle harsh
O O O O O B-A I-A O O O O O
I wasnt impressed and it wasnt SPICEY
O O O O O O O
The food was almost always EXCELLENT
O B-A O O O O
I was pleasently surprised at the taste
O O O O O O B-A
A nice space as long as it doesnt get too crowded and a singleminded devotion to its chosen cuisine make Mare a great choice for seafood lovers
O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O B-A O
I never had an orange donut before so I gave it a shot
O O O O B-A I-A O O O O O O O
they really provide a relaxing , laidback atmosphere
O O O O O O O B-A
This particular location certainly uses substandard meats
O O O O O O B-A
I stumbled upon this resteraunt on my way home from the subway
O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Management was less than accomodating
O B-A O O O O
The ambience is also more laidback and relaxed
O B-A O O O O O O
the teas are great and all the sweets are homemade
O B-A O O O O O B-A O O
mojitos and the service are the best part in there
B-A O O B-A O O O O O O
Sandwiches burgers and salads like the lemondressed cobb are classic successes
B-A B-A O B-A O O B-A I-A O O O
this restaurant is absolutely beautiful
O O O O O
The design is very intimate and romantic
O B-A O O O O O
The food was wonderful and imaginative
O B-A O O O O
The staff is very sharp and they look good too
O B-A O O O O O O O O
The worst though was the taste
O O O O O B-A
They were dry , stale and pretty flavorless
O O O O O O O O
The fajita we tried was tasteless and burned and the mole sauce was way too sweet
O B-A O O O O O O O O B-A I-A O O O O
Stay with the roasted chickens and youll be fine
O O O B-A I-A O O O O
The atmosphere is warm , comfortable , artsy and sexy
O B-A O O O O O O O O
The food is great big selection reasonable prices and the drinks are really good
O B-A O O O B-A O B-A O O B-A O O O
The steak melted in my mouth
O B-A O O O O
The food did take a few extra minutes to come , but the cute waiters jokes and friendliness made up for it
O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O
Most importantly , it is reasonably priced
O O O O O O B-A
The selection of food is excellent Im not used to having much choice at restaurants , and the atmosphere is great
O B-A I-A I-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O
Only suggestion is that you skip the dessert it was overpriced and fell short on taste
O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O B-A
Food was decent , but not great
B-A O O O O O O
I have no idea why this restaurant is so often overlooked
O O O O O O O O O O O
From the moment you walk in , you feel like youre in the perfect place
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i dont know what some people who rave about this hot dog are talking about
O O O O O O O O O O B-A I-A O O O
it is a hidden delight complete with a quaint bar and good food
O O O O O O O O O B-A O O B-A
I find that most Kosher restaurants are average to good , but this has been the best Ive eaten so far
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The waiters ALWAYS look angry and even ignore their hightipping regulars
O B-A O O O O O O O O O
the atmosphere is very nice , and a welcome escape from the rest of the SI mall
O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , theyre a bit more expensive then typical , but then again , so is their food
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A
Not terrible , but not the restaurant in the reviews of 2002
O O O O O O O O O O O O
I can say that the wraps burgers and salads were all fresh , tasty and the mango margareta at 9 was WELL WORTH the money
O O O O O B-A B-A O B-A O O O O O O O B-A I-A O O O O O O O
It was delicious and large
O O O O O
Anywhere else , the prices would be 3x as high
O O O O B-A O O O O O
The service we experienced was friendly and good
O B-A O O O O O O
Our waiter was friendly and it is a shame that he didnt have a supportive staff to work with
O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O
The folding chair I was seated at was uncomfortable
O B-A I-A O O O O O O
As we waited I watched 3 seperate groups of diners discuss how dissapointed they also were
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
An excellent choice in midtown
O O O O O
Service was among the best I have ever had in NYC
B-A O O O O O O O O O O
The fettucino alfredo was amazing
O B-A I-A O O
The food was very good and I was pleasantly surprised to see so many vegan options
O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A I-A
I know real Indian food and this wasnt it
O O O B-A I-A O O O O
Be sure to try the Smoked Trout Lamb Chops Veal Chops Rabbit the potato gratin on and on and on
O O O O O B-A I-A B-A I-A B-A I-A B-A O B-A I-A O O O O O
Even when the chef is not in the house , the food and service are right on target
O O O B-A O O O O O O O B-A O B-A O O O O
Everything from the eggs benedict to the mussels and even the hamburger were done well and very tasty
O O O B-A I-A O O B-A O O O B-A O O O O O O
The waiters were very professional , courteous and attentive
O B-A O O O O O O O
My boyfriend and I went here last night and LOVED it
O O O O O O O O O O O
The falafal was rather over cooked and dried but the chicken was fine
O B-A O O O O O O O O B-A O O
I highly reccomend the grand marnier shrimp its insanely good
O O O O B-A I-A I-A O O O
We been there and we really enjoy the food was areally great food and the service was really good
O O O O O O O O B-A O O O B-A O O B-A O O O
Desserts include flan and sopaipillas
B-A O B-A O B-A
I was starving and the small portions were driving me crazy
O O O O O O B-A O O O O
The wait staff was loud and inconsiderate
O B-A I-A O O O O
However , the food and service and dramatically lacking
O O O B-A O B-A O O O
The sushi is cut in blocks bigger than my cell phone
O B-A O O O O O O O O O
The service is great , my soup always arrives nice and hot
O B-A O O O O B-A O O O O O
It had been awhile and I forgot just how delicious crepes can be
O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O
Montparnasses desserts especially the silken creme brulee and paperthin apple tart are good enough on their own to make the restaurant worth the trip
O B-A O O O B-A I-A O O B-A I-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O
My friend told me about this restaurant for a year before he finally took me this weekend
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i had a delicious shrimp creole
O O O O B-A I-A
The chicken dinner was real good
O B-A I-A O O O
Beware of the chili signed food items not unless you want to call the fire department to douse the flames in your mouth
O O O B-A I-A I-A I-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The decor is designed in a contemporary Japanese style restaurant
O B-A O O O O O O O O
but the food was delicious
O O B-A O O
Try the ribs sizzling beef and couple it with coconut rice
O O B-A O B-A O O O O B-A I-A
The only drawback is that its a little pricey
O O O O O O O O O
Everything about this place was wonderful
O O O O O O
The avocado salad is a personal fave
O B-A I-A O O O O
And , the honey BBQ rib tips are yummy
O O O B-A I-A I-A I-A O O
The BEST Chinese food Uptown
O O B-A I-A O
Service is known for bending over backwards to make everyone happy
B-A O O O O O O O O O O
The atmosphere is attractive , but a little uncomfortable
O B-A O O O O O O O
The staff is very friendly
O B-A O O O
Waiters are very friendly and the pasta is out of this world
B-A O O O O O B-A O O O O O
Great wine list and great cocktail menu
O B-A I-A O O B-A I-A
The crab cakes are delicious and the BBQ rib was perfect
O B-A I-A O O O O B-A I-A O O
The food is wonderful , artfully done and simply delicious
O B-A O O O O O O O O
Tiny restaurant with very fast service
O O O O O B-A
The sauce may not be for everyone , since it is distintive
O B-A O O O O O O O O O O
My husband and I have been there at least 6 times and weve always been given the highest service and often free desserts
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O B-A
A beautiful atmosphere perfect for drinks andor appetizers
O O B-A O O B-A O B-A
Curionis Pizza has been around since the 1920s
O O O O O O O O
They make the best pizza in New Jersey
O O O O B-A O O O
I recently visited over this past summer after being away for a year
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What a difference , the service was very comforting and the food was better than average , but what really standed out was such a dynamic and extensive beer list
O O O O O B-A O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A I-A
Frankly , the chinese food here is something I can make better at home
O O O B-A I-A O O O O O O O O O
There was only one waiter for the whole restaurant upstairs
O O O O B-A O O O O O
We started with the scallops and asparagus and also had the soft shell crab as well as the cheese plate
O O O O B-A O B-A O O O O B-A I-A I-A O O O O B-A I-A
Not to be overlooked , the service is excellent
O O O O O O B-A O O
this without question is one of the worst hotdogs i have ever had
O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O
The staff is unbelievably friendly , and I dream about their Saag gosht so good
O B-A O O O O O O O O O B-A I-A O O
I also recommend the garlic knots
O O O O B-A I-A
Best Indian food I have ever eaten
O B-A I-A O O O O
You wont be dissapointed
O O O O
This place has the best pizza
O O O O O B-A
Culinaria is a welcome addition to the Garment district far better than any restaurant in the area
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The music which is sometimes a little too heavy for my taste
O B-A O O O O O O O O O O
The service is excellent and always informative without an air
O B-A O O O O O O O O
The owner and staff go to great lengths to make you feel comfortable
O B-A O B-A O O O O O O O O O
I cant stand this dungeon
O O O O O
The sushi is always fresh and yummy and the menu is pretty varied
O B-A O O O O O O O B-A O O O
The food was great sushi was good , but the cooked food amazed us
O B-A O O B-A O O O O O B-A I-A O O
their dinner specials are fantastic
O B-A I-A O O
Delish and made to your liking
O O O O O O
Great food great drinks nice dining atmosphere
O B-A O B-A O B-A I-A
For the price you pay for the food here , youd expect it to be at least on par with other Japanese restaurants
O O B-A O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Food portion was SMALL and below average
B-A I-A O O O O O
Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at ALL COST
O O O O O O O O O O O
since the first time I came here Ive been hooked
O O O O O O O O O O
Sit back in one of those comfortable chairs
O O O O O O O B-A
People in the neighborhood seem to love it , too
O O O O O O O O O O
in conclusion , THIS PLACE SUCKS
O O O O O O
My favs here are the Tacos Pastor and the Tostada de Tinga
O O O O O B-A I-A O O B-A I-A I-A
Nick Stefs is one of the only places worthy of going in the area , so if you happen to be by Madison Square Garden or Heralds Square check it out
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Have to tell you Not at all impressed
O O O O O O O O
The bartenders and the managers are really nice and the decor is very comfy and laidback , all the while being trendy
O B-A O O B-A O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O
For a savory take on the soup and sandwich meal try the hot and sour soup
O O O O O O B-A I-A I-A I-A O O B-A I-A I-A I-A
This bar has it all great drinks cool atmosphere excellent service and delicious food
O O O O O O B-A O B-A O B-A O O B-A
Also , the chick peas with shrimp appetizer is divine
O O O B-A I-A I-A I-A I-A O O
Finally , I got sick of the bad service obnoxious smirks , and snotty back talk
O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O
How have I never been to Agave before
O O O O O O O O
Youre going to drop some coin , but completely worth it , especially if you are looking to impress someone
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We ordered lamb which was perfectly cooked and tasted awesome
O O B-A O O O O O O O
i especially like their soft shell crab sandwich with fries
O O O O B-A I-A I-A I-A I-A I-A
if youre looking for authentic hong kongstyle food look no further
O O O O O B-A I-A I-A O O O
My wife I lived on the west side and found this while visiting firends on the UES
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
good food good wine thats it
O B-A O B-A O O
A nice find in the neighborhood
O O O O O O
The staff was extremely friendly and pleasant
O B-A O O O O O
And as SOON as one person is done , she asked to pick up the plate immediately
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This place is Italian , not French
O O O O O O O
After so many great reviews here , my bf and I went to Esca to celebrate my birthday last nite
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While their kitchen food is delicious , their Sushi is out of this world
O O B-A I-A O O O O B-A O O O O O
There was a heat problem to boot , so it was about 40 degrees in the restaurant we had to request to uncheck our coats
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everything is scrumptious , from the excellent service by cute waitresses to the extremely lush atmosphere
O O O O O O O B-A O O B-A O O O O B-A
Its traditional , simple italian food
O O O O B-A I-A
My girlfriend and I just spent our 10 month anniversary at Lou Lou
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food is allaround good , with the rolls usually excellent and the sushisashimi not quite on the same level
O B-A O O O O O O B-A O O O O B-A O O O O O O
The sashimi is cut a little thinly
O B-A O O O O O
Bay Terrace mall is nothing ok , almost nothing without it
O O O O O O O O O O O
Could have had better for 13 the price in Chinatown
O O O O O O O B-A O O
My husband and I had a blast
O O O O O O O
personally i say save your money
O O O O O O
In addition to great hot dogs DOTP has wonderful breakfast sandwiches that feature , in addition to great things like tator tots and English muffins a delicious NJbased pork product know to us Jersey girls and boys as Taylor ham
O O O O B-A I-A O O O B-A I-A O O O O O O O O O B-A I-A O B-A I-A O O O B-A I-A O O O O O O O O B-A I-A
Believe me , they live up to the name
O O O O O O O O O
Well , it happened because of a graceless manager and a rude bartender who had us waiting 20 minutes for drinks and then tells us to chill out
O O O O O O O O B-A O O O B-A O O O B-A O O O B-A O O O O O O O
Not only is the service great , but forming conversation around a table is so easy beacuse the atmosphere can be both romantic and comfortable
O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O
When the dish arrived it was blazing with green chillis definitely not edible by a human
O O B-A O O O O O B-A I-A O O O O O O
The absolute worst service Ive ever experienced and the food was below average when they actually gave people the meals they ordered
O O O B-A O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O B-A O O
Its about 7 for lunch and they have takeout or dinein
O O O O B-A O O O B-A O B-A
They are by far the BEST past in New York
O O O O O O O O O O
I have eaten here several times before attending an afternoon performance
O O O O O O O O O O O
Everything is very cheap
O O O O
Be sure to accompany your food with one of their fresh juice concoctions
O O O O O B-A O O O O B-A I-A I-A
The food is great and the prices are reasonable
O B-A O O O O B-A O O
The place is clean , and if you like soul food then this is the place to be
O B-A O O O O O O O B-A I-A O O O O O O O
Youll see a lot of people eating there after church
O O O O O O O O O O
I had roast chicken and a salad
O O B-A I-A O O B-A
Ive been a regular customer at Juice Generation for the last 3 months my office moved to the Film Center on Ninth Avenue and they are on the next block
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They have a very good chicken with avocado and good tuna as well
O O O O O B-A I-A I-A O O B-A O O
Its the kind of place I like to support
O O O O O O O O O
But the meals were terrible
O O B-A O O
My chicken was completely dried out and on the cold side and the sauce was not very flavorful
O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O
Malted Milk Ball Gelato have you ever in your life heard of anything so ridiculously wonderful

A con was the slow bar service

Dessert was also to die for
B-A O O O O O
BTW , the service is very good
O O O B-A O O O
We loved it and will go back

I would definitely come back to this restaurant
O O O O O O O O
The place just isnt ready for prime time
O O O O O O O O
All toppings are so fresh youd think they had their own vegetable garden and the crust is so perfect , that one actually thinks of how it was made
O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I went to Kitchenette this weekend for brunch
O O O O O O O B-A
This place doesnt get the publicity that Sylvias Soul Food restaurant does , but it should
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Just because P Diddy had a party at Butter doesnt mean we should be automatically impressed
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Even for two very hungry people there is plenty of food left to be taken home it reheats really well also
O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O
Like I said , Nick and Joes may not be everyones favorite , but its mine
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The help was extremely nice and did not rush us
O O O O O O O O O O
Then they somehow made a dry and burnt crust around a raw and cold inside
O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O
Its just good food nothing more and thats all we want
O O O B-A O O O O O O O
DONT KNOW WHAT THE OTHERS ON THE BLOCK WERE LIKE BUT WE WERE PLEASED WITH OUR CHOICE

The staff greeted me warmly at the door and I was seated promptly and the food was excellent

their brunch menu had something for everyone
O B-A I-A O O O O

The food is average breakfast food soups salads sandwiches etc
O B-A O O B-A I-A B-A B-A B-A O
I WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED BY THE FOOD
O O O O O O B-A
THE BANANA PUDDING THEY SERVE HAS NEVER SEEN AN OVENTHE , CRABCAKES ARE WAY OVER SALTED AND DONT GET ME STARTED ON THE VERY GREASY MAC AND CHEESE
O B-A I-A O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A I-A I-A
The staff is arrogant , the prices are way high for Brooklyn
O B-A O O O O B-A O O O O O
This place is average at best
O O O O O O
the service is prompt friendly
O B-A O O O
Whatever the reason it is definitely the place to be
O O O O O O O O O O
This is literally a hot spot when it comes to the food
O O O O O O O O O O O B-A
The downstairs bar scene is very cool and chill
O B-A I-A I-A O O O O O
The food was definitely good , but when all was said and done , I just couldnt justify it for the price including 2 drinks 100person
O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O B-A O
Ive come here for casual lunches as well as for a friends birthday and I always enjoy myself

Feels like family when we go there
O O O O O O O
I found the food to be just as good as its owner Da Silvano , just much less expensive
O O O B-A O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O
They have homemade pastas of all kinds I recommend the gnocchi yum
O O B-A I-A O O O O O O B-A O
My vegetable risotto was burnt , and infused totally in a burnt flavor
O B-A I-A O O O O O O O O O B-A
What a pleasant surprise
O O O O
The main draw of this place is the price
O O O O O O O O B-A
How can hope to stay in business with service like this

But dinner here is never disappointing , even if the prices are a bit over the top
O B-A O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O

It was delish and I didnt feel bad eating it
O O O O O O O O O O
Another friend had to ask 3 times for parmesan cheese
O O O O O O O O B-A I-A
Our waitress had apparently never tried any of the food and there was no one to recommend any wine
O B-A O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O B-A
The service was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush , this is not the place for you
O B-A O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No doubt the next time we want to go out for a special occasion or are entertaining guests from out of town , Spirit and Bateaux will be our destination
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would recommend Jewel Bako if you want to feel like you were kicked in the groin and had to pay for it too
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The ambiance was pretty cool , but not worth the hassle
O B-A O O O O O O O O O
The unfortunate lady next to us thought she had ordered a salad including asking for salad dressing and was instead given a quesedilla
O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O B-A I-A O O O O O B-A
El Nidos one of the best restaurants in New York which Ive ever been to , has a great variety of tasty , mouth watering pizzas
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A
The service was pretty poor all around , the food was well below average relative to the cost and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place
O B-A O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although I moved uptown I try to stop in as often as possible for the GREAT cheap food and to pay the friendly staff a visit

I had to wait for my friend at the bar for a few minutes

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When she complained , the waitress said , Sorry
O O O O O B-A O O O
The quality of the meat was on par with your local grocery store
O B-A I-A I-A I-A O O O O O O O O
They specialize in smoothies and fresh juices
O O O B-A O B-A I-A
It first came well done , and I politely sent it back
O O O O O O O O O O O O
I recommend the black roasted codfish it was the best dish of the evening
O O O B-A I-A I-A O O O O B-A O O O
The manager then told us we could order from whatever menu we wanted but by that time we were so annoyed with the waiter and the resturant that we let and went some place else
O B-A O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O
In mi burrito , here was nothing but dark chicken that had that cooked last week and just warmed up in a microwave taste

O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
From the erbazzone emiliana to the mostarda on the cheese plate the dishes at this restaurant are all handled with delicate care
O O B-A I-A O O B-A I-A I-A I-A I-A O B-A O O O O O O O O O
The food is delicious and the bar has a great vibe

The staff members are extremely friendly and even replaced my drink once when I dropped it outside
O B-A I-A O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O
Cool atmosphere but such a let down
O B-A O O O O O
The Sashimi portion are big enough to appease most people , but I didnt like the fact they used artifical lobster meat
O B-A I-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A I-A I-A
They have wheat crusted pizza made with really fresh and yummy ingredients
O O B-A I-A I-A O O O O O O B-A
Had a lovely dinner in this dedicated seafood joint , food was wellprepared and presented and the service was pleasant and prompt
O O O B-A O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O B-A O O O O
the icing MADE this cake it was fluffy , not ultra sweet , creamy and light
O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O
Finally let into the store 5 at a time , to buy expensive slices from a harried staff
O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O B-A
We ended up having to just leave because we were essentially being ignored by the wait staff even though the rest of the restaurant was largely empty
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A I-A O O O O O O O O O O
The wine list is extensive , well priced and covers alot of regions

They bring a sauce cart up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak I tried them ALL
O O O B-A I-A O O O B-A O O O O O O O O B-A I-A I-A O O B-A O O O O

Likewise if you like really thin crust or really big slices then Nick and Joes may not be your favorite

Thick fries meaty chili and stuffed baked potatoes round out a menu that includes a cool , ultrathick chocolate Frosty
O B-A B-A I-A O B-A I-A I-A O O O B-A O O O O O O B-A I-A
I always find myself asking the waiter to make something bland and different than what is on the menu
O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O B-A
Good cake BUT it was not the best cake ive ever had , and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees
O B-A O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A
The closest that I got was the Cherry Marscapone but they were out of it that day

The homage to India is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated , fresh take on sweetandsour
O O O O O O O O O O B-A I-A I-A O B-A I-A I-A I-A I-A I-A I-A I-A O O B-A I-A O O O O O O O O O
It doesnt look like much on the outside but the minute you walk inside , its a whole other atmosphere
O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O B-A
I have to say the place was awesome
O O O O O O O O
The ground chickpea soup we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin
O B-A I-A I-A O O O O B-A O O O
We requested they reslice the sushi and it was returned to us in small cheeselike cubes
O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O
The service however , is a peg or two below the quality of food horrible bartenders and the clientele for the most part , are rowdy , loudmouthed commuters this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff getting loaded for an ACDC concert or a Knicks game
O B-A O O O O O O O O O B-A I-A I-A O B-A O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O

Unfortunately , with our show tickets , we didnt have time to sample any desserts
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A
The restaurant could use a little paint , but all in all a great sushi place
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Make more tables perhaps a rooftop bar
O O B-A O O B-A I-A
The decoration was feeling like we was on the Cairo , actually the street is part of that adventure
O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Hip boutiques and bars on Ludlow add to the artsy , laidback atmosphere at this Israelistyle takeout and eatin burger joint

Young neighborhood trendies graze at the counter during the day , while chic , arthouse drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night

O B-A O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O B-A O O O
The food is consistant and good but how it got name Best Diner In Manhattan is beyond me
O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The pasta primavera was outstanding as well , lots of fresh veggies
O B-A I-A O O O O O O O B-A I-A

We recently spent New Years Eve at the restaurant , and had a great experience , from the wine to the dessert menu
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O B-A I-A
Highly recommended As stated , I havent dined in the restaurant but stopped by there to pick up takeout and it seems a very relaxing place also , the bar looks nice
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O B-A O O O B-A O O
The ambiance was fine , a little loud but still nice and romantic
O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O
but , the filet mignon was not very good at all cocktail hour includes free appetizers nice nonsushi selection
O O O B-A I-A O O O O O O B-A I-A O O B-A O B-A I-A
It took about 2 12 hours to be served our 2 courses
O O O O O O O O B-A O O B-A
Who said go when the place is quiet during the day
O O O O O B-A O O O O O
Can be a bit busy around peak times because of the size
O O O O O O O O O O O B-A
I was on jury duty , rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and Hibiscus lemonade
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O B-A I-A O B-A I-A
good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a glass of wine
O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O B-A I-A O O B-A I-A I-A
Very nice touch that very much fits the place
O O O O O O O O B-A
However , there is just something so great about being outdoors in great landscaping , enjoying a casual drink that makes going to this place worthwhile
O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O B-A I-A O O O O O B-A O
We were seated promptly in close proximity to the dance floor
O O O O O O O O O B-A I-A
If you are here as a preshow meal hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location
O O O O O O B-A I-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A plus was the good mix of people in their twenties that provided for great eyecandy while I was there
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The comments about fried foods is correct below but the other dishes including the lamb entree and many of the salads avocado shrimp were quite good
O O O B-A I-A O O O O O O B-A O O B-A I-A O O O O B-A I-A I-A O O O
Its best to go on a cold night with a close friend or a good book
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Slow service but when youre hanging around with groups of 10 or 20 , who really notices
O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The sauce is excellent very fresh with dabs of real mozzarella
O B-A O O O O O B-A I-A I-A I-A
Dont ever bother the drinks were awful , but it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining
O O O O B-A O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O B-A
The room is a little plain , but its difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go
O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Prices even outside of restaurant week were great
B-A O O O O O O O
A small , outdoor eating area makes for a private , comfortable space to study alone or meet up with friends
O O O B-A I-A I-A O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O
Before the place didnt call my attention
O O O O O O O
And all the female servers are cute too , which is always nice
O O O B-A I-A O O O O O O O O
The best dessert a chocolate and peanut butter tart isnt particularly Hawaiian , but its a small world when it comes to sweets
O O B-A O B-A I-A I-A I-A I-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A
for an appetizer their calamari is a winner
O O B-A O B-A O O O
Satay is one of those favorite haunts on Washington where the service and food is always on the money
O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O B-A O O O O O
After dinner I heard music playing and discovered that there is a lounge downstairs
O B-A O O B-A O O O O O O O B-A O
But now that its under new ownership and has been renovated , it looks great
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The room is a gorgeous , bilevel space and the long bar perfect for a drink
O B-A O O O O B-A I-A O O B-A I-A O O O B-A
Now we moved out of the state and every visit to NYC includes a stop here
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two complaints their appetizer selection stinks , it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu
O O O B-A I-A O O O O O O O O O B-A I-A O O B-A
I dont remember what we had nothing was memorable
O O O O O O O O O
It is bland and nothing extrodinary
O O O O O O
I was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service to a 15 person party
O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O
The chicken and falafel platters were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad
O B-A I-A I-A I-A O O O O B-A I-A I-A
Every time I visit NYC , I come here
O O O O O O O O O
Ive been coming here regularly since it opened , about 2 years ago
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The atmosphere takes you to that place , the place many dream of
O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O
several times and put up with the waiters bad manners , knowing that their job isnt easy
O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O
The service is great maybe even borderline nagging but at least you get attention , the desserts are excellent and the coffee is so very good
O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O B-A O O O O
We were seated next to a couple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since were all foodies who eat out a lot that this wasnt a place wed return to
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are served on Focacchia bread and are to die for
O O B-A O B-A I-A O O O O O
While the smoothies are a little big for me , the fresh juices are the best I have ever had
O O B-A O O O O O O O O B-A I-A O O O O O O O
The food is just OKAY , and its almost not worth going unless youre getting the pialla which is the only dish thats really good
O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O B-A O O O
The guac is fresh , yet lacking flavor we like to add our fresh salsa into it
O B-A O O O O O B-A O O O O O B-A I-A O O
The new menu has a few creative itemsthey , were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites but they raised the prices the staff is friendly most of the time , but I must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words No , cant , sorry , boy , they wont bend the rules for anyone
O B-A I-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It only open for lunch but the food is so good
O O O O B-A O O B-A O O O
If you like seafood andor Greek food you will love this place though it is not limited to just these things
O O O B-A O B-A I-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The menu includes pub fare burgers steaks and shepherds pie and even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as vegetarians
O B-A O B-A I-A B-A B-A O B-A I-A O O O B-A I-A O O O O O O O
How can they survive serving mediocre food at exorbitant prices
O O O O O O B-A O O B-A
The food was mediocre and the service was severely slow
O B-A O O O O B-A O O O
i have eaten here on a different occasion the food is mediocre for the prices
O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O B-A
Im looking forward to going back soon and eventually trying most everything on the menu
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A
I just had my first visit to this place and cant wait to go back and slowly work my way through the menu
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A
I asked repeatedly what the status of the meal was and was pretty much grunted at by the unbelievably rude waiter
O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O B-A
I stopped by for some brunch today and had the vegan cranberry pancakes and some rice milk
O O O O O B-A O O O O B-A I-A I-A O O B-A I-A
Weekends can get crowded , but still highly recommended
O O O O O O O O O
It gets very crowded so I would suggest that you get their early
O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sweet Irish bartender is always happy and able to bring a smile to my friends a my face
O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I always find myself sitting next to someone in the theatre industry interesting to hear ideas hashed out while having a quick bite to eat
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Its good to go there for drinks if you dont want to get drunk because youll be lucky if you can get one drink an hour the service is so bad
O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O B-A O O O
Anyway , the owner was fake
O O O B-A O O
Owner is pleasant and entertaining
B-A O O O O
I have never in my life sent back food before , but I simply had to , and the waiter argued with me over this
O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O O O O O O B-A O O O O O
Although the restaurant itself is nice , I prefer not to go for the food
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-A
Creamy appetizers taramasalata eggplant salad and Greek yogurt with cuccumber , dill , and garlic taste excellent when on warm pitas
