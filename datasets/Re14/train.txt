But	O
the	O
staff	B-A
	O
was	O
so	O
horrible	O
to	O
us.	O

To	O
be	O
completely	O
fair,	O
the	O
only	O
redeeming	O
factor	O
was	O
the	O
food	B-A
,	O
which	O
was	O
above	O
average,	O
but	O
couldn't	O
make	O
up	O
for	O
all	O
the	O
other	O
deficiencies	O
of	O
Teodora.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
uniformly	O
exceptional,	O
with	O
a	O
very	O
capable	O
kitchen	B-A
	O
which	O
will	O
proudly	O
whip	O
up	O
whatever	O
you	O
feel	O
like	O
eating,	O
whether	O
it's	O
on	O
the	O
menu	B-A
	O
or	O
not.	O

Where	O
Gabriela	O
personaly	O
greets	O
you	O
and	O
recommends	O
you	O
what	O
to	O
eat.	O

For	O
those	O
that	O
go	O
once	O
and	O
don't	O
enjoy	O
it,	O
all	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
is	O
that	O
they	O
just	O
don't	O
get	O
it.	O

Not	O
only	O
was	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
outstanding,	O
but	O
the	O
little	O
'perks	B-A
'	O
were	O
great.	O

It	O
is	O
very	O
overpriced	O
and	O
not	O
very	O
tasty.	O

Our	O
agreed	O
favorite	O
is	O
the	O
orrechiete	B-A
with	I-A
sausage	I-A
and	I-A
chicken	I-A
	O
(usually	O
the	O
waiters	B-A
	O
are	O
kind	O
enough	O
to	O
split	O
the	O
dish	B-A
	O
in	O
half	O
so	O
you	O
get	O
to	O
sample	O
both	O
meats	B-A
).	O

The	O
Bagels	B-A
	O
have	O
an	O
outstanding	O
taste	O
with	O
a	O
terrific	O
texture,	O
both	O
chewy	O
yet	O
not	O
gummy.	O

Nevertheless	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
itself	O
is	O
pretty	O
good.	O

They	O
did	O
not	O
have	O
mayonnaise	B-A
,	O
forgot	O
our	O
toast	B-A
,	O
left	O
out	O
ingredients	B-A
	O
(ie	O
cheese	B-A
	O
in	O
an	O
omelet	B-A
),	O
below	O
hot	O
temperatures	O
and	O
the	O
bacon	B-A
	O
was	O
so	O
over	O
cooked	O
it	O
crumbled	O
on	O
the	O
plate	B-A
	O
when	O
you	O
touched	O
it.	O

It	O
took	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
to	O
get	O
our	O
check	B-A
,	O
which	O
was	O
perfect	O
since	O
we	O
could	O
sit,	O
have	O
drinks	B-A
	O
and	O
talk!	O

The	O
design	B-A
	O
and	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
is	O
just	O
as	O
good.	O

He	O
has	O
visited	O
Thailand	O
and	O
is	O
quite	O
expert	O
on	O
the	O
cuisine	B-A
.	O

I	O
would	O
definitely	O
recommend	O
Mary's	O
and	O
am	O
making	O
it	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
regular	O
neighborhood	O
haunts.	O

The	O
pizza	B-A
	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
if	O
you	O
like	O
thin	B-A
crusted	I-A
pizza	I-A

My	O
Girlfriend	O
and	O
I	O
stumbled	O
onto	O
this	O
hopping	O
place	O
the	O
other	O
night	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
time!	O

He	O
can't	O
help,	O
they're	O
bought	O
up	O
so	O
fast.	O

Secondly,	O
on	O
this	O
night	O
the	O
place	O
was	O
overwhelmed	O
by	O
upper	O
east	O
side	O
ladies	O
perfume.	O

i	O
have	O
eaten	O
here	O
a	O
handful	O
of	O
times,	O
for	O
no	O
reason	O
besides	O
sheer	O
convenience.	O

Obviously	O
run	O
by	O
folks	O
who	O
know	O
a	O
pie.	O

We	O
were	O
very	O
disappointed.	O

IT	O
IS	O
DEFINITELY	O
SPECIAL	O
AND	O
AFFORDABLE.	O

I	O
really	O
liked	O
this	O
place.	O

I	O
will	O
be	O
going	O
back	O
very	O
soon.	O

All	O
the	O
money	O
went	O
into	O
the	O
interior	B-A
decoration	I-A
,	O
none	O
of	O
it	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
chefs	B-A
.	O

The	O
seats	B-A
	O
are	O
uncomfortable	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
sitting	O
against	O
the	O
wall	O
on	O
wooden	O
benches.	O

I	O
asked	O
for	O
seltzer	B-A
with	I-A
lime	I-A
,	O
no	O
ice.	O

It	O
was	O
pretty	O
inexpensive	O
too.	O

Will	O
not	O
be	O
back.	O

Don't	O
go	O
alone---even	O
two	O
people	O
isn't	O
enough	O
for	O
the	O
whole	O
experience,	O
with	O
pickles	B-A
	O
and	O
a	O
selection	B-A
of	I-A
meats	I-A
and	I-A
seafoods	I-A
.	O

My	O
suggestion	O
is	O
to	O
eat	B-A
family	I-A
style	I-A
	O
because	O
you'll	O
want	O
to	O
try	O
the	O
other	O
dishes	B-A
.	O

Best	O
of	O
all	O
is	O
the	O
warm	O
vibe	B-A
,	O
the	O
owner	B-A
	O
is	O
super	O
friendly	O
and	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
fast.	O

This	O
isn't	O
a	O
value	O
joint.	O

Faan's	O
got	O
a	O
great	O
concept	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
rough	O
on	O
the	O
delivery	B-A
.	O

From	O
the	O
incredible	O
food	B-A
,	O
to	O
the	O
warm	O
atmosphere	B-A
,	O
to	O
the	O
friendly	O
service	B-A
,	O
this	O
downtown	O
neighborhood	O
spot	O
doesn't	O
miss	O
a	O
beat.	O

Great	O
food	B-A
	O
at	O
REASONABLE	O
prices	B-A
,	O
makes	O
for	O
an	O
evening	O
that	O
can't	O
be	O
beat!	O

Look	O
foward	O
to	O
trying	O
the	O
Ruben	O
upon	O
returning.	O

The	O
only	O
other	O
steakhouse	O
that	O
seems	O
to	O
hold	O
a	O
candle	O
to	O
Roth's	O
is	O
the	O
Strip	O
House.	O

We	O
usually	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
Chart	O
House	O
to	O
celebrate	O
a	O
birthday	O
or	O
anniversary.	O

this	O
little	O
place	O
has	O
a	O
cute	O
interior	B-A
decor	I-A
	O
and	O
affordable	O
city	O
prices	B-A
.	O

You'll	O
adore	O
it.	O

Two	O
words:	O
Free	O
wine	B-A
.	O

The	O
price	B-A
	O
is	O
reasonable	O
although	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
poor.	O

The	O
quantity	B-A
	O
is	O
also	O
very	O
good,	O
you	O
will	O
come	O
out	O
satisfied.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
to	O
Roth's	O
twice	O
and	O
both	O
times	O
were	O
very	O
disappointing.	O

Worth	O
visiting	O
the	O
1st	O
Ave	O
spot	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
original	O
store.	O

I	O
stumbled	O
upon	O
this	O
second	O
floor	O
walk-up	O
two	O
Fridays	O
ago	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
with	O
two	O
friends	O
in	O
town	O
from	O
L.A.	O
Being	O
serious	O
sushi	B-A
	O
lovers,	O
we	O
sat	O
at	O
the	O
sushi	B-A
bar	I-A
	O
to	O
be	O
closer	O
to	O
the	O
action.	O

Raga's	O
is	O
a	O
romantic,	O
cozy	O
restaurant.	O

The	O
fried	B-A
rice	I-A
	O
is	O
amazing	O
here.	O

Three	O
courses	B-A
	O
-	O
choices	O
include	O
excellent	O
mussels	B-A
,	O
puff	B-A
pastry	I-A
goat	I-A
cheese	I-A
	O
and	O
salad	B-A
with	I-A
a	I-A
delicious	I-A

,	O
and	O
a	O
hanger	B-A
steak	I-A
au	I-A
poivre	I-A
	O
that	O
is	O
out	O
of	O
this	O
world.	O

it's	O
a	O
perfect	O
place	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
amanzing	O
indian	B-A
food	I-A
.	O

The	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
so	O
cool	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
prompt	O
and	O
curtious.	O

At	O
the	O
end	O
you're	O
left	O
with	O
a	O
mild	O
broth	B-A
with	I-A
noodles	I-A
	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
slurp	O
out	O
of	O
a	O
cup.	O

I	O
just	O
wonder	O
how	O
you	O
can	O
have	O
such	O
a	O
delicious	O
meal	B-A
	O
for	O
such	O
little	O
money	B-A
.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
delicious	O
but	O
do	O
not	O
come	O
here	O
on	O
a	O
empty	O
stomach.	O

The	O
wine	B-A
list	I-A
	O
is	O
excellent.	O

so	O
garantuan	O
that	O
you	O
can't	O
fit	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
toaster.	O

Ive	O
been	O
to	O
many	O
Thai	O
restaurants	O
in	O
Manhattan	O
before,	O
and	O
Toons	O

by	O
far	O
the	O
best	O
Thai	B-A
food	I-A
	O
Ive	O
had	O
(except	O
for	O
my	O
mom's	O
of	O
course).	O

They	O
wouldnt	O
even	O
let	O
me	O
finish	O
my	O
glass	B-A
of	I-A
wine	I-A
	O
before	O
offering	O
another.	O

I	O
highly	O
recommend	O
the	O
Sophia	O
pizza.	O

Whem	O
asked,	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
ask	O
more	O
detailed	O
questions	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
knew	O
what	O
the	O
specials	B-A
	O
were.	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
consistently	O
great	O
place	O
to	O
dine	B-A
	O
for	O
lunch	B-A
	O
or	O
dinner	B-A
.	O

Nice	O
atmosphere	B-A
,	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
pleasant	O
and	O
the	O
desert	B-A
	O
was	O
good.	O

All	O
the	O
people	O
that	O
I	O
bring	O
there	O
go	O
back	O
on	O
their	O
own	O
and	O
bring	O
THEIR	O
friends!	O

After	O
really	O
enjoying	O
ourselves	O
at	O
the	O
bar	B-A
	O
we	O
sat	O
down	O
at	O
a	O
table	B-A
	O
and	O
had	O
dinner	B-A
.	O

Fabulous	O
service	B-A
,	O
fantastic	O
food	B-A
,	O
and	O
a	O
chilled	O
out	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
and	O
environment	B-A
.	O

Not	O
what	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
hear.	O

Try	O
the	O
lasagnette	B-A
appetizer	I-A
.	O

Pricey,	O
but	O
worth	O
a	O
try,	O
at	O
least	O
once.	O

I've	O
been	O
there	O
a	O
few	O
times,	O
and	O
I	O
usually	O
end	O
up	O
sitting	O
next	O
to	O
some	O
pretty	O
odd	O
people.	O

I	O
liked	O
the	O

have	O
yet	O
to	O

a	O

my	O

Wine	B-A
list	I-A

	O
is	O
good	O
and	O
wine-by-the-glass	B-A
	O
was	O
generously	O

to	O
the	O

With	O
the	O
great	O

on	O
the	O
menu	B-A
	O
,	O
I	O
eat	O
here	O
often	O
and	O
never	O
get	O
bored	O
.	O

The	O
menu	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
limited	O
-	O
i	O
think	O
we	O
counted	O
4	O
or	O
5	O
entrees	B-A

If	O
you	O
are	O
a	O
carnivore,	O
come	O
hungry	O
and	O
you	O
will	O
leave	O
more	O
satisfied	O
than	O
you	O
have	O
ever	O
been.	O

The	O
menu	B-A
	O
is	O
limited	O
but	O
almost	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
dishes	B-A
	O
are	O
excellent.	O

Not	O

Great	O
bagels	B-A
,	O

and	O
a	O

The	O

	O
varys	O
from	O
day	O
to	O
day-	O
sometimes	O
they're	O
very	O
nice,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
not.	O

whoever	O
the	O
jazz	O

was,	O
they	O
were	O
on	O
POINT.	O

One	O
thing	O
I	O
liked	O
about	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
that	O
I	O
never	O
felt	O
rushed	O
or	O
pressured	O
to	O
give	O
up	O
my	O
table	B-A
	O
ot	O

This	O
place	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
bargain.	O

We	O
happened	O
upon	O
this	O
place	O
purely	O
by	O
accident	O
and	O
were	O
pleased	O
with	O
the	O
results.	O

Unfortunately,	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
outstanding,	O
but	O
everything	O
else	O
about	O
this	O
restaurant	O
is	O
the	O

they	O
also	O

We	O
always	O
have	O
a	O

	O
and	O
always	O

My	O

Everyone	O

super	O

and	O
willing	O
to	O
the	O

The	O

	O
was	O
pretty	O

Sapphire	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
Indian	O
restaurant	O
I	O
go	O
to	O
when	O
I'm	O
in	O
NYC.	O

The	O
cuisine	B-A
	O
from	O
what	O
I've	O
gathered	O
is	O
authentic	O
Taiwanese,	O
though	O
its	O
very	O
different	O
from	O
what	O
I've	O
been	O
accustomed	O
to	O
in	O
Taipei.	O

I	O
heartily	O
recommend.	O

Heartland	O
Brewery	O
is	O
by	O
far	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
places	O
in	O
NYC	O
to	O
make	O
new	O
friends	O
and	O
catch	O
up	O
with	O
old	O
ones.	O

I	O
almost	O
hesititate	O
to	O
write	O
a	O
review	O
because	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
was	O
so	O
great	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
hate	O
for	O
it	O
too	O
become	O
to	O
crowded.	O

They	O
are	O
often	O
crowded	B-A
	O
on	O
the	O
weekends	O
but	O
they	O
are	O
efficient	O
and	O
accurate	O
with	O
their	O
service	B-A
.	O

All	O
my	O
co-workers	O
were	O
amazed	O
at	O
how	O
small	O
the	O
dish	B-A
	O
was.	O

The	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
is	O
unheralded,	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
impecible,	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
magnificant.	O

We	O
ordered	O
the	O
special,	O
grilled	B-A
branzino	I-A
,	O
that	O
was	O
so	O
infused	O
with	O
bone,	O
it	O
was	O
difficult	O
to	O
eat.	O

The	O
wait	B-A
staff	I-A
	O
is	O
friendly,	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
has	O
gotten	O
better	O
and	O
better!	O

This	O
place,	O
which	O
is	O
only	O
a	O
few	O
months	O
old,	O
is	O
perhaps	O
Queens'	O
biggest	O
secret!	O

It	O
may	O
be	O
a	O
bit	O
packed	B-A
	O
on	O
weekends,	O
but	O
the	O
vibe	B-A
	O
is	O
good	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
French	B-A
food	I-A
	O
you	O
will	O
find	O
in	O
the	O
area.	O

This	O
place	O
is	O
so	O
much	O
fun.	O

I	O
was	O
glad	O
I	O
did.	O

Right	O
off	O
the	O
L	O
in	O
Brooklyn	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
nice	O
cozy	O
place	B-A
	O
with	O
good	O
pizza	B-A
.	O

I've	O
never	O
been	O
treated	O
so	O
rudely.	O

I'll	O

Le	O
Pere	O
Pinard	O
has	O
a	O
$15	O
pre-theater	B-A
menu	I-A
	O
that	O
is	O
outstanding.	O

Went	O
inside	O
and	O
I	O
started	O
to	O
get	O
excited.	O

I	O
also	O
ordered	O
for	O
delivery	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
restaurant	O
forgot	O
half	O
the	O
order	B-A
.	O

Our	O
server	B-A
	O
checked	O
on	O
us	O
maybe	O
twice	O
during	O
the	O
entire	O
meal	B-A
.	O

However,	O
it	O
is	O
jus	O
too	O
good	O
to	O
not	O
praise	O
it.	O

We	O
have	O
been	O
to	O
Montparnasse	O
many	O

The	O
strong	O
scents	B-A
	O
coming	O
from	O
the	O
left	O

right	O
of	O
me	O
negatively	O
affected	O
my	O
taste	O
buds.	O

We	O
had	O
the	O
lobster	B-A
sandwich	I-A
	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
FANTASTIC.	O

It's	O
somewhere	O
you	O
can	O
eat	O
and	O
be	O
happy.	O

If	O
you	O
wrote	O
a	O
bad	O
review,	O
it's	O
because	O
you	O
don't	O
understand	O
what	O
Rao's	O
is	O
all	O
about.	O

Had	O
we	O
been	O
stalling	O
I	O
could	O
understand	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
coming	O
from,	O
but	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
there	O
less	O
than	O
an	O
hour	O
and	O
they	O
hadn't	O
even	O
brought	O
us	O
a	O
check	B-A
	O
yet!	O

but	O
overall	O
i	O
give	O

	O

out	O

Other	O
than	O
the	O

	O
from	O
two	O

it's	O
great.	O

What	O
more	O
can	O
you	O
ask	O
for?	O

Wondering	O
who	O

the	O

They	O

You	O
are	O

There's	O

the	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
always	O
tastes	O
fresh	O
and	O
served	B-A
	O
promptly.	O

I	O
know	O
because	O
I	O
live	O
nearby.	O

The	O

My	O

the	O

But	O
who	O
says	O
Murray's	O
is	O
anything	O
about	O
service	B-A
.	O

This	O
place	O
is	O
really	O
trendi	O
but	O
they	O
have	O
forgotten	O
about	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
part	O
of	O
a	O
	O
restaurant,	O
the	O
food	B-A
.	O

I	O
have	O

Hats	O

done	O
in	O
a	O
back	O

away	O
from	O
customers.	O

Service	B-A
	O
could	O
be	O
improved	O
but	O
overall	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
place	O
that	O
understands	O
the	O
importance	O
of	O
little	O
things	O
(the	O
heavy,	O
black,	O
antique-seeming	O

Glad	O
you	O

the	O
luxury	O
to	O
throw	O
out	O

customers.	O

The	O
pizza	B-A
	O
is	O
delicious	O
-	O
they	O
use	O
fresh	B-A
mozzarella	I-A
	O
instead	O
of	O
the	O
cheap,	O
frozen,	O
shredded	O
cheese	B-A
	O
common	O
to	O
most	O
pizzaria's.	O

Its	O
an	O
excellent	O
place	B-A
	O
to	O

and	O
the	O
food	B-A

one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O

never	O
had	O
a	O
problem	O
walking	O
in	O
and	O
getting	B-A
a	I-A

The	O

	O
was	O

it	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
bistro-type	B-A

.	O

Check	O
it	O
out	O

First	O
off,	O
the	O

	O

completely	O
unattentive	O
the	O
2	O

we	O
saw	O
her(odd	O
in	O
a	O
restaurant	O
with	O
6	O

and	O
got	O
our	O
order	O
wrong.	O

Don't	O
go.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
bland	O
oily.	O

But	O
they	O
do.	O

What	O
is	O
even	O
better,	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
prices	B-A
	O
are	O
very	O
affordable	O
as	O
well,	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
really	O
good.	O

The	O
fish	B-A
	O
is	O
fresh	O
but	O
the	O

	O
is	O
nothing	O
out	O

Look	O

It's	O
a	O
really	O
great	O
deal,	O
considering	O
we	O
got	O
full	O
off	O
of	O
four	O
dollars.	O

I	O
understand	O
the	O

and	O
folks	O
you	O

I	O

Eating	O

the	O

	O
saves	O
it,	O

at	O
your	O

it's	O

the	O

It	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
handled	O
better.	O

The	O

her	O

	O
was	O

The	O

the	O

!	O

It's	O
a	O
rather	O
cramped	O
and	O
busy	O
restaurant	O
and	O
it	O
closes	O
early.	O

The	O
environment	B-A
	O
is	O
romantic,	O
but	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
horrible,	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
pathetic,	O
and	O
gabriella	O
lies	O
about	O
everything	O
she	O
could.	O

We	O
had	O
crawfish	B-A
boiled	I-A
	O
and	O
despite	O
making	O
a	O
mess,	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
ton	O
of	O
fun	O
and	O
quite	O
tasty	O
as	O
well.	O

I	O
had	O
very	O
high	O
expectations	O
for	O
this	O
place	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
reservation	B-A
	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
months	O
in	O
advance	O
for	O
a	O
special	O
occasion.	O

They	O
were	O
served	O
warm	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
soft	O
fluffy	O
interior.	O

What	O
came	O
to	O
our	O
table	B-A
	O
was	O
burned	O
beyond	O
recognition	O
and	O
stringy.	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
Pad	B-A
Thai	I-A
	O
and	O
the	O
noodles	B-A
	O
were	O
sticky.	O

So	O
I've	O
never	O
actually	O
been	O
to	O
M	O
proper,	O
but	O
I've	O
had	O
it	O
delivered	B-A

a	O

times.	O

the	O

when	O

what	O

versus	O

so	O

the	O

there	O
is	O
no	O

The	O

	O
is	O
rude	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
of	O

which	O
was	O
out	O

Okay	O
service	B-A

The	O
only	O
thing	O
more	O
wonderful	O
than	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
(which	O
is	O
exceptional)	O
is	O
the	O
service	B-A
.	O

We	O
were	O
very	O
pleasantly	O
surprised.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
just	O
awful,	O
ATROCIOUS	O
actually.	O

I	O
will	O
never	O
visit	O
this	O
restaurant	O
again.	O

The	O
soup	B-A
for	I-A
the	I-A

was	O
soy	B-A
sauce	I-A

The	O

excellent,	O
especially	O
the	O
calamari	B-A
,	O
as	O
were	O
the	O
filling	B-A
pasta	I-A
mains	I-A
.	O

The	O

	O
suggested	O
glasses	B-A
of	I-A

	O
that	O
went	O
very	O
well	O
with	O
the	O
food	B-A

(or	O
sister,	O
in	O
my	O
case!).	O

I've	O
eaten	O
at	O
many	O
different	O
Indian	O
restaurants.	O

They	O
might	O
be	O
all	O
business	O
at	O
the	O
counter	B-A
	O
when	O
you	O
give	O
your	O
order,	O
but	O
their	O
food	B-A
	O
says	O
I	O
love	O
you.	O

We	O
are	O
very	O
particular	O
about	O
sushi	B-A
	O
and	O
were	O
both	O
please	O
with	O
every	O
choice	O
which	O
included:	O

their	O
plain	B-A
pizza	I-A
	O
with	O
fresh	O
garlic	B-A
	O
or	O
eggplant	B-A
.	O

Don't	O
go	O
there!	O

Ok,	O
so	O
the	O
servers	B-A
	O
wander	O
around	O
a	O
little	O
clueless,	O
but	O
there's	O
more	O
than	O
enough	O
servers	B-A
	O
for	O
the	O
crowd	O
they	O
get	O
--	O
it's	O
fine,	O
you	O
just	O
have	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
small	O
effort	O
to	O
get	O
their	O
attention.	O

Good	O
luck	O
getting	B-A
a	I-A
table	I-A
.	O

We	O
picked	O
it	O
randomly,	O
without	O
a	O
recommendation	O
from	O
someone	O
who	O
has	O
been	O
there,	O
so	O
we	O
weren't	O
sure	O
what	O
to	O
expect.	O

Don't	O
look	O
down	O
your	O
nose	O
at	O
me	O
like	O
that...	O

Planet	O
Thai	O
is	O
great!	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
awful.	O

Just	O
don't	O
do	O
it.	O

Just	O
ignore	O
the	O
trendy	O
wannabes.	O

The	O
takeout	B-A
menu	I-A
	O
says	O
to	O
keep	O
an	O
eye	O
out	O
for	O
an	O
expanded	O
menu	B-A
	O
offering	O
more	O
italian	B-A
dishes	I-A
,	O
I	O
can't	O
wait!	O

Trust	O
me,	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
great,	O
and	O
all	O
of	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
devoured	O
in	O
no	O
time.	O

My	O
girlfiends	O
and	O
I	O
ate	O
at	O
O.G.	O
again	O
last	O
night.	O

I	O
wish	O
they	O
had	O
one	O
near	O
my	O

I	O
would	O
go	O
everyday.	O

Finally!	O

Amma	O
has	O
the	O
worst	O
value	O
for	O
money	O
I	O
have	O
experienced	O
in	O
NYC	O
over	O
the	O
past	O
2	O
years.	O

I	O
am	O
not	O
the	O
most	O
experienced	O
person	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
Thai	B-A
food	I-A
,	O
but	O
my	O
friend	O
who	O
took	O
me	O
there	O
is.	O

I	O
think	O
this	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
pretty	O
good	O
spot	O
if	O
it	O
were	O
not	O
so	O
overpriced	O
and	O
overrated.	O

Regardless	O
of	O
whether	O
there	O
are	O
two	O
people	O
or	O
two	O
hundred	O
people	O
ahead	O
of	O
you	O
the	O
hostess	B-A
	O
will	O
take	O
your	O
name	O
and	O
tell	O
you	O
Five	O
minutes.	O

The	O
pizza	B-A
	O
is	O
good	O
though.	O

bottles	B-A
of	I-A
wine	I-A
	O
are	O
cheap	O
and	O
good.	O

You	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
disapointed	O
at	O
all.	O

Walk-ins	O
are	O
risky	O
too.	O

The	O
have	O
over	O
100	O
different	O
beers	B-A
	O
to	O
offer	O
thier	O
guest	O
so	O
that	O
made	O
my	O
husband	O
very	O
happy	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
delicious,	O
if	O
I	O
must	O
recommend	O
a	O
dish	B-A
	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
the	O
pumkin	B-A
tortelini	I-A
.	O

They	O
didn't	O
give	O
us	O
the	O
dinner	B-A
special	I-A
	O
until	O
we	O
asked	O
for	O
it.	O

You	O
must	O

the	O
crabmeat	B-A
lasagna	I-A
	O
which	O

dishes	I-A
	O
and	O
never	O
leave	O
until	O
you've	O
had	O
the	O

Very	O
good	O
service	B-A
	O
and	O
very	O
good	O
prices	B-A

I	O
recently	O
went	O
to	O
this	O
restaurant	O
with	O
some	O
co-workers	O
for	O
lunch	B-A
	O
and	O
had	O
an	O
amazing	O
time.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
impeccable	O
and	O
unobtrusive	O
--	O
the	O
staff	B-A
	O
knows	O
what	O
they	O
are	O
there	O
to	O
do	O
--	O
to	O
know	O
their	O
menu	B-A

present	O
your	O

and	O
attend	O

your	O

Ess-A-Bagel	O
(either	O
by	O
Sty-town	O
or	O
midtown)	O
is	O
by	O
far	O
the	O
best	O
bagel	B-A
	O
in	O
NY.	O

Our	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
great	O
too!	O

Open	O
late	O
(well	O
as	O
late	O
as	O
I	O
ever	O
got	O
there	O
and	O
I'm	O
a	O
night	O
person)	O

The	O
most	O
annoying	O
thing,	O
though,	O
is	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
servers	B-A
	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
trained	O
to	O
drive	O
revenue.	O

Get	O
your	O
food	B-A
	O
to	O
go,	O
find	O
a	O
bench,	O
and	O
kick	O
back	O
with	O
a	O
plate	B-A
of	I-A
dumplings	I-A

Please	O
try	O
the	O
Filet	B-A
Mignon	I-A
,	O
its	O
just	O
the	O
most	O
tender	O
piece	O
ever.	O

Everything	O
we	O
had	O
was	O
pretty	O
good,	O
but	O
we	O
have	O
only	O
been	O
there	O
once.	O

We	O
were	O
still	O
sitting	O
at	O
the	O
bar	B-A
	O
while	O
we	O
drank	O
the	O
sangria	B-A
,	O
but	O
facing	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
bar	B-A
	O
when	O
we	O
turned	O
back	O
around,	O
the	O
$2	O
was	O
gone	O
the	O
people	O
next	O
to	O
us	O
said	O
the	O
bartender	B-A
	O
took	O
it.	O

Something	O
about	O
them	O
being	O
busy	O
with	O
holiday	O
party's.	O

The	O
sake	B-A
menu	I-A
	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
overlooked!	O

I	O
would	O
highly	O
recommend.	O

This	O
place	O
is	O
great.	O

the	O
drinks	B-A
	O
are	O
amazing	O
and	O
half	O
off	O
till	O
8pm.	O

i've	O
been	O
back	O
to	O
nha	O
trang	O
literally	O
a	O
hundred	O
times	O
for	O
the	O
beef	B-A
cubes	I-A
	O
-	O
they're	O
that	O
good.	O

With	O
so	O
many	O
poor	O
experiences	O
to	O
be	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
theater	O
district,	O
is	O
truly	O
an	O
excellent	O
find!	O

This	O
has	O
got	O
to	O
be	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
overrated	O
restaurants	O
in	O
Brooklyn.	O

The	O
service	B-A
,	O
wine	B-A
selection	I-A
,	O
ambiance	B-A
	O
are	O
all	O
outstanding	O
and	O
deserve	O
recognition.	O

Went	O
there	O
last	O
night	O
for	O
2	O
year	O
anniversery,	O
and	O
wasn't	O
all	O
that	O
impressed.	O

It	O
was	O
rather	O
pathetic	O
that	O
it	O
took	O
them	O
over	O
an	O
hour	O
to	O
seat	O
us.	O

We	O
were	O
seated	O
promptly	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
reservations	B-A
,	O
however	O
after	O
that	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
slow.	O

At	O
first	O
I	O
was	O
slightly	O
skeptical	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
sushi	O
restaurant	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
NYC.	O

It's	O
really	O
also	O
the	O
service	B-A
,	O
is	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
waiters	B-A
	O
are	O
friendly.	O

Suan	O
was	O
a	O
recommendation	O
that	O
I	O
am	O
glad	O
we	O
heeded.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
pretty	O
good,	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
flavorless	O
and	O
the	O
portions	B-A
	O
very	O
small,	O
including	O
dessert	B-A
.	O

We	O
visit	O
at	O
least	O
once	O
a	O
month.	O

It	O
is	O
set	O
far	O
from	O
the	O
small	O
street	O
it's	O
on,	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
traffic	B-A
noise	I-A
.	O

Also,	O
the	O
place	O
is	O
popular	O
with	O
families,	O
so	O
if	O
you're	O
bothered	O
by	O
children	O
running	O
loose	O
like	O
wild	O
animals,	O
come	O
later	O
at	O
night	O
to	O
avoid	O
them.	O

I'll	O
keep	O
this	O
short.	O

I	O
felt	O
as	O
though	O
I	O
were	O
eating	O
in	O
Paris.	O

Lived	O
in	O
Shanghai	O
most	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
and	O
thought	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
comparable	O
to	O
the	O
flagship	O
Green	O
Bo	O
restaurant	O
there.	O

I	O
highly	O
recommend	O
Cafe	O
St.	O
Bart's	O
for	O
their	O
food	B-A
,	O
the	O
ambience	B-A
	O
and	O
wonderful	O
service	B-A
.	O

However,	O
it's	O
not	O
worth	O
a	O
special	O
trip.	O

Nice	O
value.	O

Gigino's	O
in	O
Wagner	O
Park	O
is	O
so	O
enjoyable.	O

And	O
it	O
was	O
quick	O
which	O
is	O
very	O
important.	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
nice	O
restaurant	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
looking	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
place	O
to	O
host	O
an	O
intimate	O
dinner	B-A
meeting	I-A
	O
with	O
business	O
associates.	O

All	O
the	O
NYU	O
students	O
love	O
this	O
place	O
so	O
it	O
makes	O
for	O
a	O
fun	O
young	O
atmosphere	B-A
.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
here	O
does	O
a	O
great	O
service	O
to	O
the	O
name	O
(Cantonese	B-A
	O
that	O
is...).	O

But,	O
nothing	O
stands	O
out	O
about	O
the	O
cooking	B-A
.	O

Joya	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
cool	O
spot	O
with	O
decent	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
a	O
colorful	O
-	O
if	O
not	O
relaxed	O
-	O
atmosphere	B-A
.	O

If	O
that's	O
a	O
problem,	O
go	O
to	O
McDonald's	O
and	O
destroy	O
your	O
insides.	O

The	O
Prix	B-A
Fixe	I-A
menu	I-A
	O
is	O
worth	O
every	O
penny	O
and	O
you	O
get	O
more	O
than	O
enough	O
(both	O
in	O
quantity	B-A
	O
AND	O
quality	B-A
).	O

I've	O
been	O
here	O
3	O
times	O
for	O
lunch	B-A
	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
favorites	O
in	O
the	O
city.	O

I	O
had	O
their	O
eggs	B-A
benedict	I-A
	O
for	O
brunch	B-A
,	O
which	O
were	O
the	O
worst	O
in	O
my	O
entire	O
life,	O
I	O
tried	O
removing	O
the	O
hollondaise	B-A
sauce	I-A
	O
completely	O
that	O
was	O
how	O
failed	O
it	O
was.	O

I	O
work	O
near-by,	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
the	O
BEST	O
oatmeal	B-A
	O
in	O
the	O
neighborhood-	O
not	O
a	O
packaged	O
or	O
quick-cooked	O
item.	O

Always	O
busy	O
but	O
fast	O
moving.	O

Too	O
bad	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
wasn't	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
heritage.	O

The	O
menu	B-A
	O
looked	O
good,	O
except	O
for	O
offering	O
the	O
Chilean	B-A
Sea	I-A
Bass	I-A
,	O
but	O
the	O
server	B-A
	O
does	O
not	O
offer	O
up	O
the	O
specials	B-A
	O
that	O
were	O
written	O
on	O
the	O
board	O
outside.	O

Sexy.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
really	O
good,	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
onion	B-A
soup	I-A
	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
ever.	O

I	O
will	O
have	O
to	O
say,	O
this	O
Bengali	O
Fast	O
Food	O
joint	O
is	O
clearly	O
my	O
favorite.	O

I'm	O
not	O
picky	O
-	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
actually	O
gross.	O

overall,	O
a	O
solid	O
restaurant	O
and	O
at	O
less	O
than	O
$40pp	O
(including	O
wine	B-A
),	O
a	O
solid	O
deal	O
as	O
well.	O

Since	O
it	O
literally	O
is	O
a	O
complete	O
hole	O
in	O
the	O
wall,	O
it's	O
a	O
bit	O
intimidating	O
at	O
first,	O
but	O
you	O
get	O
over	O
that	O
very	O
quickly	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
friendly	O
staff	B-A
	O
welcomes	O
you	O
-	O
don't	O
hesitate	O
to	O
ask	O
for	O
help	O
with	O
what	O
to	O
get.	O

Based	O
on	O
the	O
reviews	O
for	O
dinner	B-A
,	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
place	O
I	O
would	O
reconsider	O
revisiting	O
for	O
that,	O
but	O
definitely	O
not	O
for	O
Dim	B-A
Sum	I-A
	O
again.	O

It	O
costs	O
$2	O
extra	O
to	O
turn	O
a	O
regular	O
roll	B-A
	O
into	O
an	O
inside-out	O
roll	B-A
,	O
but	O
the	O
roll	B-A
	O
more	O
than	O
triples	O
in	O
size,	O
and	O
that's	O
not	O
just	O
from	O
the	O
rice	B-A
.	O

Even	O
with	O
John's	O
and	O
Joe's	O
around	O
the	O
corner,	O
this	O
place	O
will	O
make	O
a	O
name	O
for	O
itself.	O

It	O
melted	O
in	O
my	O
little	O
mouth	O
and	O
the	O
perfect	O
consistency-not	O
too	O
fishy,	O
creamy,	O
and	O
slightly	O
buttery.	O

When	O
he	O
finally	O
did,	O
he	O
was	O
unable	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
gin	B-A
and	I-A
tonic	I-A
	O
--	O
couldn't	O
find	O
tonic	B-A
.	O

My	O
girlfriend	O
convinced	O
me	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
the	O
other	O
night	O
for	O
a	O
quick	O
bite.	O

The	O
dim	B-A
sum	I-A
	O
is	O
ok	O
but	O
doesn't	O
taste	O
that	O
fresh,	O
and	O
the	O
little	B-A
dishes	I-A
	O
don't	O
look	O
steamy	O
hot	O
as	O
they	O
should	O
(also	O
note	O
lack	O
of	O
Chinese	O
here).	O

despite	O
the	O
untasteful	O
previous	O
review...	O

Don't	O
judge	O
this	O
place	O
prima	O
facie,	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
try	O
it	O
to	O
believe	O
it,	O
a	O
home	O
away	O
from	O
home	O
for	O
the	O
literate	O
heart.	O

Sure,	O
everyone's	O
got	O
their	O
favorite,	O
but	O
to	O
know	O
Sal,	O
is	O
to	O
know	O
New	O
York.	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
absolutely	O
brilliant	O
and	O
well	O
runned	O
business	O
operation.	O

Also	O
they	O
were	O
$15	O
each!	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
ok,	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
didn't	O
get	O
what	O
they	O
asked	O
for.	O

My	O
friends	O
spoke	O
so	O
much	O
about	O
it	O
for	O
months,	O
I	O
finally	O
made	O
the	O
time	O
to	O
come	O
down	O
ear	O
and	O
dine	O
in.	O

If	O
you	O
want	O
good	O
authentic	O
Thai	B-A
	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
place	O
to	O
go.	O

I	O
recommend	O
getting	O
a	O
reservation	B-A
	O
even	O
though	O
we	O
saw	O
people	O
seated	O
without	O
one.	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
I	O
moderately	O
enjoyed	O
was	O
their	O
Grilled	B-A
Chicken	I-A
special	I-A
with	I-A
Edamame	I-A
Puree	I-A
.	O

This	O
is	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
neighborhood	O

come.	O

If	O
you	O
want	O
some	O

,	O
pork	B-A
	O
or	O
chicken	B-A
on	I-A
rice	I-A
with	I-A
ginger	I-A
,	O
try	O
them	O
out!	O

You	O
order	O
from	O
a	O
menu	B-A
,	O
so	O
you	O
leave	O
feeling	O
like	O
you	O
missed	O
the	O
full	O
experience.	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
more	O
authentic	O
Shanghainese	O

We	O

every	O
time	O
we	O
are	O
in	O
the	O
City.	O

we	O
love	O
th	O
pink	O

So	O
eat	O
fast	O
and	O
order	O
a	O
lot.	O

Staff	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
accomodating.	O

I	O
have	O
to	O
agree	O
with	O
the	O
previous	O
reviewer.	O

--Eat	O

If	O

when	O

give	O
this	O

If	O

you'd	O
better	O

yourself	O

have	O
dinner	B-A
	O
here	O
and	O
see	O
if	O
you	O
dont	O
agree	O
with	O
me.	O

Definitely	O
a	O
great	O

for	O

Not	O

The	O

was	O
terrific	O
and	O
the	O

	O
classy,	O

without	O

This	O
is	O
an	O
amazing	O

to	O

the	O

the	O

but	O
we	O

only	O
a	O

Quick	O
and	O

service	B-A
.	O

Authentic	O

They	O
are	O
tasty,	O
but	O
I	O
suggest	O
only	O
eating	O
one	O
with	O
meat	B-A
	O
because	O
they	O
tend	O
not	O
to	O
mesh	O
that	O
well	O
with	O
the	O
average	O
American	O
digestive	O
system.	O

Somewhat	O
pricey	O
but	O
what	O
the	O
heck.	O

It's	O
true,	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
not	O
cheap.	O

Try	O
the	O
hot	B-A

	O
too,	O
they're	O
snappy	O
and	O
delicious.	O

Delivery	B-A

whom	O
have	O
a	O
story.	O

We	O
generally	O
like	O
good	O
restaurants	O
and	O
eat	O
out	O
often	O
but	O
Kai	O
was	O
way	O
to	O
expensive	O
for	O
what	O
we	O
got.	O

What	O
a	O
great	O
place.	O

The	O
sangria	B-A
	O
was	O
pretty	O
tasty	O
and	O
good	O
on	O
a	O
hot	O
muggy	O
day.	O

Don't	O
eat	O
here	O
unless	O
you're	O
starving	O
for	O
thai	B-A
food	I-A
	O
and	O
you	O
work	O
next	O
door.	O

This	O
tiny	O
Williamsburg	O
spot	O
is	O
always	O
pleasantly	O
surprising.	O

For	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
want	O
great	O
food	B-A
	O
plus	O
great	O
service	B-A
,	O
Roxy	O
is	O
a	O
place	O
to	O
AVOID!	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
best	O
ravioli	B-A
	O
ever.	O

While	O
the	O
menu	B-A
	O
isn't	O
especially	O
groundbreaking,	O
everything	O
I've	O
tried	O
so	O
far	O
has	O
been	O
well-executed	O
and	O
tasty.	O

Ive	O
been	O
here	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
times	O
now	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
always	O
outstanding.	O

The	O
bill	B-A
	O
is	O
approximately	O
$25	O
for	O
2	O
at	O
lunch	B-A
	O
without	O
drinks	B-A
.	O

Quite	O
frankly,	O
this	O
is	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
worst	O
sushi	B-A
	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
tried.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
great,	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
ok.	O

The	O
overall	O
price	B-A
tag	I-A
	O
was	O
very	O
very	O
expensive,	O
something	O
I	O
did	O
expect.	O

By	O
the	O
time	O
we	O
were	O
done,	O
it	O
was	O
past	O
1:00am.	O

Spice	O
is	O
great	O
Thai	B-A
food	I-A
,	O
love	O
the	O
inexpensive	O
appetizers	B-A
.	O

Read	O
all	O
the	O
other	O
review,	O
they'll	O
confirm	O
it.	O

Even	O
after	O
they	O
overcharged	O
me	O
the	O
last	O
time	O
I	O
was	O
there.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
attentive.	O

He	O
not	O
only	O
makes	O
his	O
own	O
homemade	O
mozzarella	B-A
,	O
but	O
every	O
pie	B-A
	O
is	O
ultra	O
fresh.	O

Fish	B-A
	O
was	O
overdone.	O

Great	O
idea	O
and	O
base	O
for	O
restaurant,	O
but	O
work	O
on	O
the	O
details,	O
people	O
who	O
think	O
this	O
was	O
good	O
need	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
towns	O
and	O
rethink	O
what	O
it	O
should	O
have	O
tasted	O
like.	O

When	O
you're	O
sitting	O
in	O
their	O
main	B-A
dining	I-A
room	I-A
	O
(which	O
has	O
a	O
spectacular,	O
hand-painted	O
high	O
ceiling	B-A
)	O
you'd	O
never	O
know	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
world	O
outside.	O

We	O
visited	O
Bread	O
Bar	O
during	O
January	O
restaurant	O
week	O
and	O
were	O
so	O
pleased	O
with	O
the	O
menu	B-A
selections	I-A
	O
and	O
service	B-A
.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
twice	O
to	O
this	O
restaurant.	O

also	O
make	O
sure	O
you	O
pay	O
attention	O
to	O
the	O
music	B-A
	O
being	O
piped	O
in	O
-	O
quite	O
a	O
weird	O
selection.	O

You	O
could	O
get	O
a	O
much	O
better	O
dining	O
experience	O
for	O
the	O
same	O
amount	O
of	O
money	O
in	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
other	O
French	O
Bistros.	O

The	O
establishment	B-A
	O
scores	O
big	O
points	O
in	O
presentation	O
and	O
style.	O

The	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O

sum	I-A
,	O
though	O
pricey	O
by	O
Chinatown	O
standards,	O
is	O
worth	O
it.	O

Good	O

.	O

The	O
wait	B-A
staff	I-A
	O
is	O
very	O
friendly,	O
if	O
not	O
overly	O
efficient.	O

Surprisingly	O
nothing	O
could	O
be	O
further	O
from	O
the	O
truth.	O

The	O
dim	B-A
sum	I-A
	O
however	O
was	O
very	O
good.	O

It's	O
better	O
than	O
being	O
on	O
the	O
roof	O
of	O
Sutton	O

with	O
19	O

Service	B-A
	O
has	O
always	O
been	O
friendly	O
and	O
efficient.	O

Went	O
there	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
combination	O
of	O
different	O
seafood	B-A
dishes	I-A
	O
and	O
appetizers	B-A
.	O

Its	O
a	O
great	O
place	O
for	O
a	O
casual	O
date	O
or	O
to	O
entertain	O
clients	O
for	O
lunch	B-A
.	O

All	O
we	O
received	O
was	O
an	O
apology	O
as	O
we	O
left	O
to	O
see	O
our	O
show	O
without	O
dinner	B-A
.	O

The	O
table	O
next	O
to	O
us	O
asked	O
if	O
he	O
crushed	O
the	O
grapes	B-A
	O
himself	O
when	O
their	O
long	O
overdue	O
bottle	B-A
of	I-A
wine	I-A
	O
finally	O
arrived.	O

Prices	B-A
	O
are	O
very	O
good.	O

We	O
could	O
not	O
catch	O
our	O
waiter	B-A
's	O
eye,	O
and	O
he	O
ignored	O
us.	O

Fantastic	O
place.	O

Plain	O
and	O
simple	O
it's	O
bad	O
thai	B-A
food	I-A
.	O

Definitely	O
not	O
a	O
restaurant	O
to	O
skip!	O

They	O
refuse	O
to	O
seat	O
parties	O
of	O
3	O
or	O
more	O
on	O
weekends.	O

Usually	O
3	O
vs.	O

While	O
certain	O

	O
are	O
excellent	O
(the	O
burger	B-A
,	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
pastas	B-A
),	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
not	O
really	O
the	O
point.	O

The	O
Dim	B-A
Sum	I-A
	O
was	O
so-so,	O
but	O
not	O
spectacular.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
so-so.	O

The	O
waitress	B-A
,	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
concerned	O
of	O
looking	O
good	O
than	O
actually	O
waitressing.	O

The	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
larger	O
than	O
most	O
and	O
features	O
adequate	O
seating	B-A
	O
unlike	O
most	O
joints,	O
and	O
has	O
a	O
bar	B-A
	O
which	O
deserves	O
a	O
mention.	O

What	O
a	O
ripoff!	O

Threw	O

There	O

a	O

but	O
shorter	O
than	O
I	O
expected.	O

The	O
lobster	B-A
sandwich	I-A
	O
is	O
$24	O
and	O
although	O
it	O
was	O
good	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
nearly	O
enough	O
to	O
warrant	O
that	O
price	B-A

May,	O
the	O
owner	B-A
	O
always	O
has	O
a	O
smile	O
on	O
her	O
and	O
will	O
warmly	O
greet	O
you.	O

I've	O
lived	O
in	O
NY	O
for	O
5	O
years	O
and	O
this	O
place	O
has	O
it	O
all.	O

I	O
just	O
read	O
Mocaramel's	O
review	O
and	O
felt	O
compelled	O
to	O
respond.	O

The	O
sides	B-A
	O
were	O
ok	O
and	O
incredibly	O
salty.	O

It	O
hits	O
the	O
spot	O
every	O
time	O

For	O
some	O
reason,	O
all	O
the	O
seafood	B-A
	O
on	O
the	O
menu	B-A
	O
was	O
unavailable	O
except	O
for	O
the	O
Salmon	B-A
.	O

Not	O
a	O
large	O
place	B-A
,	O
but	O
it's	O
cute	O
and	O
cozy.	O

Don't	O
be	O
fooled	O
by	O
crowds	O
of	O
people.	O

and	O
there's	O
no	O
way	O
out.	O

The	O
beverages	B-A
	O
were	O
excellent,	O
and	O
the	O
dessert	B-A
	O
was	O
good.	O

The	O
hostess	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
waitress	B-A
	O
were	O
incredibly	O
rude	O
and	O
did	O
everything	O
they	O
could	O
to	O
rush	O
us	O
out.	O

Next	O
time,	O
we	O
wouldn't	O
dare	O
ordering	O
anything	O
else	O
other	O
than	O
some	O
simple	O
Asian	B-A
appetizers	I-A
	O
and	O
drinks	B-A
.	O

Please	O
if	O
your	O
thinking	O
about	O
it	O
go,	O
and	O
stay	O
the	O
wait	B-A
	O
you	O
won't	O
be	O
disappointed.	O

I	O
must	O
say	O
the	O
view	B-A
	O
of	O
NYC	O
is	O
so	O
beautiful!	O

If	O
you'd	O
like	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
nice	O
light	O
meal	B-A
	O
with	O
an	O
asian	O
accent,	O
Long	O
Tan	O
is	O
a	O
good	O
place	O
on	O
the	O

When	O
going	O
out	O
for	O
a	O
nice	O
dinner	B-A
,	O
I	O
like	O
a	O
nice	O
ambiance	B-A
	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
very	O
good	O
food	B-A
.	O

For	O
all	O
you	O
lazy	O
folks	O
that	O
don't	O
want	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
Alphabet	O
City,	O
I	O
say,	O
good	O
-	O
stay	O
out.	O

Otherwise,	O
this	O
place	O
has	O
great	O
service	B-A
	O
and	O
prices	B-A
	O
and	O
a	O
nice	O
friendly	O
atmosphere	B-A

Highly	O
recommend	O
this	O
as	O
great	O
value	B-A
	O
for	O
excellent	O
sushi	B-A
	O
and	O
service	B-A
.	O

This	O
place	O
would	O
be	O
so	O
much	O
better	O
served	B-A
	O
by	O
being	O
run	O
by	O
a	O
group	O
that	O
actually	O
understands	O
customer	O
service	B-A
.	O

A++	O
	O
	O
The	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
good	O
to	O
excellent	O
along	O
with	O
the	O
attitude	B-A
.	O

This	O
is	O
my	O
fourth	O
try	O
over	O
a	O
two	O
year	O
period,	O
and	O
I'm	O
done.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
awesome	O
-	O
definitely	O
try	O
the	O
striped	B-A
bass	I-A
.	O

The	O
music	B-A
	O
does	O
get	O
a	O
little	O
loud	O
at	O
times,	O
but	O
it	O
just	O
made	O
me	O
want	O
to	O
lean	O
closer	O
to	O
my	O
beautiful	O
wife,	O
and	O
as	O
I	O
did,	O
I	O
got	O
a	O
whiff	O
of	O
corriander	B-A
.	O

black	B-A
white	I-A
shakes	I-A
	O
came	O
out	O
good	O
also.	O

It's	O
simply	O
the	O
best	O
meal	B-A
	O
in	O
NYC.	O

Probably	O
would	O
not	O
go	O
again...	O

After	O
passing	O
by	O
this	O
restaurant	O
for	O
sometime	O
I	O
finally	O
decided	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
and	O
have	O
dinner	B-A
.	O

The	O
seating	B-A
	O
was	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
trying	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
maximum	O
amount	O
of	O
people	O
into	O
the	O
restaurant,	O
so	O
be	O
nice	O
to	O
your	O
neighbor	O
when	O
you	O
dine	O
here.	O

I	O
ordered	O
the	O
chu	B-A
chu	I-A
curry	I-A
	O
and	O
my	O
friend	O
ordered	O
the	O
pad	B-A
thai	I-A
chicken	I-A
.	O

We	O
go	O
on	O
Mondays	O
for	O
the	O
prix	B-A
fixe	I-A
	O
and	O
our	O
experience	O
with	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
has	O
been	O
comparable	O
to	O
Blue	O
Ribbon.	O

Tuk	O
Tuk	O
is	O
my	O
second	O
favorite	O
neighborhood	O
Thai	O
place	O
(the	O
first	O
being	O
Joya).	O

However,	O
they've	O
got	O
the	O
most	O
amazing	O
pastrami	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
soups	B-A
	O
hit	O
the	O
spot.	O

Great	O
bagels	B-A
	O
made	O
the	O
old-fashioned	O
way.	O

This	O
is	O
some	O
really	O
good,	O
inexpensive	O
sushi	B-A
.	O

my	O
personal	O
favorite	O
is	O
an	O
everything	O
bagel	B-A
with	I-A
lox	I-A
spread	I-A
,	O
but	O
all	O
the	O
bagles	B-A
	O
are	O
unbeliavably	O
good.	O

I	O
wouldn't	O
even	O
have	O
complained	O
at	O
all	O
if	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
at	O
least	O
tasted	O
good	O
but	O
the	O
quality	B-A
of	I-A
food	I-A
	O
was	O
crappy,	O
too.	O

For	O
the	O
next	O
hour	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
we	O
stood	O
in	O
the	O
crowded	O
lobby	B-A
area	I-A
	O
of	O
this	O
touristy	O
restaurant	O
listening	O
to	O
all	O
types	O
of	O
explanations	O
of	O
why	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
being	O
seated	B-A
.	O

The	O
pizza	B-A
	O
is	O
delicious	O
and	O
the	O
proprietor	B-A
	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
nicest	O
in	O
NYC.	O

Also	O
good	O
for	O
client	O
lunch	B-A
meetings	I-A
,	O
esp.	O

For	O
$600	O
(	O
the	O
most	O
we	O
have	O
ever	O
paid)	O
not	O
even	O
waving	O
a	O
magic	O

will	O
ever	O
get	O
us	O
back	O
for	O
a	O
repeat	O
performance.	O

The	O
decor	B-A
	O
is	O
dark,	O
cool	O
and	O
soothing,	O
while	O
the	O
food's	B-A
presentation	I-A
	O
is	O
spectacular,	O
considering	O
the	O
low	O
prices	B-A

The	O
Waitstaff	B-A
	O
were	O
very	O
nice	O
and	O
suggested	O

	O
for	O
my	O

he	O
enjoyed	O
his	O

.	O

The	O
setting	B-A
	O
is	O
casual	O
and	O
romantic.	O

IT	O
WAS	O
HORRIBLE.	O

Terrible,	O
terrible	O
management	B-A
	O

The	O

are	O
more	O

then	O

French	O

The	O
Italian	B-A

	O
has	O
flavor	O
(that	O
can	O
be	O
sort	O
of	O
surprising	O
on	O
the	O
UES),	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
turns	O
from	O
a	O
nightmare	O
to	O
attentive,they	O
sort	O
of	O
remind	O
me	O
of	O
the	O
NY	O
Yankees	O
of	O
the	O
late	O
90's,	O
no	O
matter	O
how	O
bad	O
it	O

you	O

that	O

As	O

in	O

but	O
is	O
not	O
a	O

during	O

I	O
found	O
the	O

	O
to	O
be	O
outstanding,	O
particulary	O
the	O
salmon	B-A

I	O

The	O

The	O
food	B-A

at	O

for	O
what	O

by	O

they	O

it	O

The	O

	O
was	O
very	O
patient	O
with	O
us	O
and	O
the	O

It	O

Its	O
not	O
the	O

Great	O

the	O

to	O
you.	O

Maybe	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
an	O
unintentional	O
mistake	O
but	O
I've	O
experienced	O
the	O

with	O
other	O

so	O
I	O
don't	O
appreciate	O
such	O

Two	O

The	O

	O
remembers	O
me	O
and	O
is	O
very	O
friendly,	O
she	O
knows	O
what	O
my	O

Long	O

for	O
the	O
first	O

what	O
the	O
NY	O
TIMES	O
and	O
many	O
more	O
in	O
the	O
neighborhood	O
already	O
knew.	O

Go	O
there	O
on	O
an	O
empty	O
stomach	O
and	O
leave	O
feeling	O
like	O
a	O
baby	O
Veal	O
Calf(ok	O
bad	O
joke),	O
but	O
you	O
will	O
see.	O

While	O
we	O
thoroughly	O
enjoyed	O
the	O
food	B-A
,	O
it	O
was	O
annoying	O
to	O
scream	O
across	O
the	O
table	O
for	O
conversation.	O

Me	O
and	O
my	O
girls	O
will	O
definitely	O
go	O
back.	O

The	O
first	O
time	O
the	O
sushi	B-A
	O
was	O
outstanding,	O
the	O
second	O
time	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
bland.	O

The	O
portions	B-A
	O
are	O
large	O
and	O
the	O
servers	B-A
	O
always	O
surprise	O
us	O
with	O
a	O
different	O
starter	B-A
.	O

delicious	O

,	O
especially	O
when	O
right	O
out	O

Ive	O
passed	O
by	O
the	O
spot	O
tons	O
of	O
times	O
always	O
wanting	O
to	O
go	O
in.	O

All	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
hot	O
tasty.	O

Have	O
been	O
several	O
times	O
and	O
it	O
never	O
dissapoints.	O

This	O
is	O
one	O
great	O
place	O
to	O
eat	O
pizza	B-A
	O
more	O
out	O
but	O
not	O
a	O
good	O
place	O
for	O
take-out	B-A
pizza	I-A
.	O

Our	O
server	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
helpful	O
and	O
friendly.	O

Try	O
green	B-A
curry	I-A
with	I-A
vegetables	I-A

Would	O
recommend	O
this	O
place	O
as	O
a	O
good	O
date	O
spot	O
if	O
you	O
don't	O
want	O
to	O
drop	O
a	O
ton	O
of	O
cash.	O

While	O
I'm	O
not	O
sure	O
that	O
this	O
happens	O
all	O
the	O
time-this	O
is	O
the	O
kind	O
of	O
treatment	O
that	O
buys	O
repeat	O
business!	O

This	O
place	O
was	O
not	O
ALL	O
THAT!	O

First	O
of	O
all,	O
this	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
*not*	O
romantic,	O
as	O
claimed	O
by	O
Citysearch's	O
editorial	O
review.	O

The	O
second	O
you	O
walk	O
through	O
the	O
heavy	O
vault	O
like	O
door	B-A
,	O
with	O
people	O
anticipating	O
your	O
arrival	O
you	O
get	O
the	O
sense	O
that	O
you	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
dining	O
ride	O
of	O
a	O
lifetime.	O

Much	O
more	O
reasonably	O
priced	B-A
	O
too!	O

If	O
you	O
venture	O
off	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Manhattan	O
and	O
can't	O
seem	O
to	O
find	O
a	O
great	O
Italian	O
restaurant,	O
drive	O
to	O
Corona.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
not	O
very	O
tasty,	O
the	O
portioins	B-A
	O
were	O
tiny	O
even	O
for	O
such	O
a	O
high	O
quality	O
restaurant.	O

My	O
friend	O
from	O
Milan	O
and	O
myself	O
were	O
pleasantly	O
surprised	O
when	O
we	O
arrived	O
and	O
everyone	O
spoke	O
italian.	O

Others	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
other	O
restaurants	O
and	O
feel	O
sad	O
until	O
they're	O
eaten.	O

Why	O
make	O
a	O
reservation	B-A
	O
if	O
you	O
aren't	O
going	O
to	O
keep	O
it?	O

The	O
Pad	B-A
Thai	I-A
	O
is	O
excellent	O
here,	O
as	O
well.	O

Big	O
and	O
gawky	O
on	O
the	O
outside.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
to	O
Mary's	O
many	O
times	O
and	O
I	O
like	O
it.	O

Searching	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
from	O
the	O
cold,	O
freezing	O
weather,	O
we	O
went	O
into	O
what	O
we	O
thought	O
was	O
a	O
deli.	O

I	O
do	O
not	O
recommend	O
lunch	B-A
specials	I-A
	O
just	O
because	O
it	O
tasts	O
the	O
same	O
with	O
other	O
regular	O
chinese	O
restaurant.	O

HIGHLY	O
RECOMMENDED!!!!!	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
thing	O
in	O
Soho.	O

Went	O
here	O
last	O
night	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
pleasant	O
experience.	O

We	O
parked	O
on	O
the	O
block	O
of	O
Nina's	O
the	O
place	B-A
	O
looked	O
nice,	O
with	O
people	O
obviously	O
enjoying	O
their	O
pizzas	B-A
.	O

I	O
came	O
here	O
with	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
for	O
our	O
anniversary	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
highly	O
recommended	O
to	O
him	O
by	O
a	O
friend.	O

For	O
$760	O
for	O
2	O
people,	O
it's	O
a	O
once	O
in	O
a	O
lifetime	O
experience.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
o.k.,	O
but	O
not	O
any	O
better	O
than	O
what	O
you	O
get	O
at	O
a	O
good	O
neighborhood	O
restaurant.	O

We	O
had	O
the	O
pot-stickers	B-A
	O
which	O
were	O
great	O
and	O
a	O
tempura	B-A
dish	I-A
	O
that	O
was	O
great.	O

I	O
think	O
the	O
stuff	B-A
	O
was	O
better	O
than	O
Disney.	O

After	O
reading	O
the	O
good	O
reviews	O
of	O
this	O
restaurant,	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
give	O
it	O
a	O
try	O
with	O
two	O
friends.	O

While	O
the	O
$20	O
entree	B-A
range	I-A
	O
is	O
not	O
overly	O
expensive,	O
in	O
New	O
York	O
City,	O
there	O
is	O
definitely	O
better	O
food	B-A
	O
in	O
that	O
range,	O
and	O
so	O
Sapphire,	O
despite	O
it's	O
lovely	O
atmosphere	B-A
,	O
will	O
most	O
likely	O
not	O
be	O
a	O
restaurant	O
to	O
which	O
I	O
will	O
return.	O

Orsay,	O
is	O
without	O
a	O
doubt	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
values	O
for	O
authentic	O
French	B-A
food	I-A
	O
in	O
NYC.	O

I	O
had	O
been	O
searching	O
really	O
hard	O
for	O
a	O
restaurant	O
in	O
New	O
York	O
where	O
I	O
could	O
really	O
feel	O
unwanted	O
and	O
ignored	O
and	O
I	O
finally	O
found	O
it!	O

It's	O
definately	O
not	O
a	O
place	O
to	O
go	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
impress	O
someone.	O

Well,	O
their	O
deliveries	B-A
	O
take	O
for	O
ever	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
usually	O
cold.	O

The	O
staff	B-A
	O
is	O
no	O
nonsense.	O

Chinese	O
Desserts	O
are	O
known	O
for	O
healthful	O
benefits	O
in	O
addition	O
to	O
the	O
sweetness.	O

Wonderful	O
at	O
holiday	O
time.	O

And	O
really	O
large	O
portions	B-A
.	O

The	O
place	O
is	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
fun.	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
Thai	O
restaurant	O
with	O
a	O
very	O
friendly	O
staff	B-A
.	O

Have	O
eaten	O
at	O
Ginger	O
House	O
several	O
times,	O
and	O
it's	O
always	O
good.	O

I	O
ordered	O
the	O
smoked	B-A
salmon	I-A
and	I-A
roe	I-A
appetizer	I-A
	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
off	O
flavor.	O

We	O
went	O
here	O
for	O
lunch	B-A
	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
weeks	O
ago	O
on	O
a	O
Saturday,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
thoroughly	O
impressed	O
with	O
the	O
food	B-A
.	O

I	O
recommend	O
the	O
garlic	B-A
shrimp	I-A
,	O
okra	B-A
(bindi)	I-A
,	O
and	O
anything	O
with	O
lamb	B-A
.	O

As	O
a	O
Japanese	O
native,	O
I've	O
lived	O
in	O
the	O
Tristate	O
area	O
for	O
over	O
8	O
years,	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
just	O
so	O
amazed	O
at	O
this	O
place.	O

To	O
give	O
you	O
an	O
idea	O
of	O
how	O
good	O
we	O
thought	O
it	O
was,	O
we	O
ended	O
up	O
going	O
to	O
Ping's	O
three	O
weekends	O
in	O
a	O
row!!!	O

As	O
we	O
were	O
leaving,	O
the	O
couple	O
standing	O
by	O
the	O
door	O
said	O
to	O
another	O
waiter	B-A
,	O
we're	O
not	O
in	O
a	O
hurry.	O

The	O
menu	B-A
	O
was	O
impressive	O
with	O
selections	O
ranging	O
from	O
a	O
burger	B-A
,	O
to	O
steak	B-A
,	O
to	O
escargot	B-A
.	O

In	O
fact,	O
two	O
people	O
could	O
really	O
share	O
one	O
plate	B-A
.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
great	O
and	O
authentic.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
repeat	O
visit	O
and	O
we'll	O
definitely	O
be	O
back	O
again.	O

during	O
happy	O
hour!	O

Good	O
for	O
casual	B-A
dinner	I-A
	O
with	O
jeans	O
and	O
sneakers.	O

Love	O
YUKA.	O

Anyway,	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
good,	O
the	O
price	B-A
	O
is	O
right	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
decent	O
wine	B-A
list	I-A
.	O

Go,	O
go,	O
hurry,	O
before	O
everyone	O
finds	O
out	O
about	O
it.	O

Prices	B-A
	O
are	O
higher	O
to	O
dine	O
in	O
and	O
their	O
chicken	B-A
tikka	I-A
marsala	I-A
	O
is	O
quite	O
good.	O

I	O
am	O
bringing	O
my	O
whole	O
family	O
back	O
next	O
time.	O

This	O
place	O
has	O
many	O
different	O
styles	B-A
of	I-A
pizza	I-A
	O
and	O
they	O
are	O
all	O
amazing.	O

The	O
photos	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	O
in	O
its	O
web	O
site	O
are	O
way	O
better	O
than	O
the	O
real	O
look	B-A
.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
lousy	O
-	O
too	O
sweet	O
or	O
too	O
salty	O
and	O
the	O

	O
tiny.	O

	O

Their	O

YUCK.	O

It	O
takes	O
forever	O
to	O

The	O

looked	O
very	O
appetizing	O
and	O
delicious	O
since	O
it	O
came	O
on	O
a	O

I	O

every	O

The	O

terrible	O
and	O
overall,	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
avoid	O
at	O

I've	O

Unfortunately,	O
the	O

	O
was	O
NOT	O
something	O
to	O
get	O

It's	O
constantly	O
open,	O
catering	O
to	O
the	O
Pakistani	O
cabbies	O
lined	O
up	O
on	O
Crosby	O

so	O
there's	O
more	O
turnover	O
with	O
the	O

	O
than	O
you'd	O
expect	O
(i.e.,	O

Every	O
time	O
in	O
New	O
York	O
I	O
make	O
it	O
a	O
point	O
to	O
visit	O
Restaurant	O
Saul	O
on	O
Smith	O
Street.	O

My	O
boyfriend	O
and	O
I	O
went	O
there	O
to	O
celebrate	O
my	O
birthday	O
the	O
other	O
night	O
and	O
all	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
is	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
magnificent.	O

So	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
a	O
nice,	O
enjoyable	O
meal	B-A
	O
at	O
Montparnasse,	O
go	O
early	O
for	O
the	O
pre-theater	B-A
prix-fixe	I-A
.	O

Over	O
the	O
years,	O
it	O
has	O
always	O
provided	O
a	O
pleasurable	O
dining	B-A
	O
experience	O
with	O
quality	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
wine	B-A
.	O

I	O
would	O
go	O
back	O
tho.	O

The	O
photobook	O
menu	B-A
	O
was	O
a	O
cute	O
touch,	O
certainly	O
helped	O
my	O
group	O
and	O
I	O
pick	O
the	O
fried	B-A
chicken	I-A
,	O
pork	B-A
chop	I-A
,	O
and	O
noodle	B-A
dishes	I-A
	O
that	O
we	O
all	O
ordered.	O

too	O
large	O
for	O
just	O
two	O
people	O
but	O
nothing	O
was	O
left.	O

I	O
cannot	O
imagine	O
better	O
Indian	B-A
food	I-A
	O
in	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
city.	O

Great	O
romantic	O
place	B-A
	O
for	O
a	O
date	O
(try	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
corner	B-A
booth	I-A
table	I-A
	O
for	O
a	O
little	O
privacy	B-A
	O
and	O
to	O
sit	O
close!).	O

A	O
pleasant	O
surprise.	O

I	O
asked	O
for	O
an	O
open	B-A
faced	I-A
cheese	I-A
sandwich	I-A
	O
and	O
the	O
manager	B-A
	O
basically	O
told	O
me	O
to	O
take	O
my	O
business	O
elsewhere!	O

If	O
you	O
don't	O
mind	O
all	O
that	O
noise	O
then	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
Chart	O
House.	O

We	O
got	O
most	O
of	O
it	O
back	O
at	O
home	O
with	O
us.	O

Get	O
there	O
before	O
7pm.	O

very	O
good	O
breads	B-A
	O
as	O
well.	O

if	O
this	O
happens,	O
just	O
ask	O
for	O
real	O
naan	B-A
.	O

We	O
were	O
fans	O
of	O
the	O
half-price	B-A
Saturday	I-A
night	I-A
option	I-A
	O
until	O
some	O
inedible	O
squid	B-A
	O
during	O
a	O
recent	O
visit.	O

So,	O
if	O
yo	O
really	O
don't	O
care	O
who	O
is	O
sittingnext	O
to	O
you,	O
which	O
is	O
about	O
2	O
inches	O
away,	O
I	O
would	O
say	O
try	O
it.	O

Pizza	B-A
	O
is	O
terrific,	O

Definitely	O

This	O

My	O

one	O
friday	O
evening	O
with	O
a	O

Example	O
is	O
the	O

	O
which	O
was	O
about	O
6	O
oz	O
for	O
$12	O
dollars	O
and	O
the	O
mushrooms	B-A
	O
where	O
$12	O

about	O
1oz.	O

Service	B-A
	O
is	O
not	O
exactly	O
five	O
star,	O
but	O
thats	O
not	O
really	O
a	O
big	O
deal.	O

There	O
are	O
other	O

From	O
beginning	B-A

MUST	O
TRY	O
THIS	O

the	O

	O
to	O
the	O
rice	B-A
	O
to	O
the	O
seaweed	B-A
	O
was	O
absolutely	O
amazing.	O

This	O
place	O
started	O
off	O
a	O
little	O
iffy,	O
but	O
is	O
now	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
favorite	O
indian	O
restaurants	O
in	O
NYC	O
(and	O
I'm	O

know).	O

They	O
also	O

a	O
great	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
this	O
restaurant	O
with	O
a	O
woman	O
that	O
I	O
met	O
recently.	O

The	O
dishes	B-A
	O
offered	O
were	O
unique,	O
very	O
tasty	O
and	O
fresh	O
from	O
the	O
lamb	B-A
sausages	I-A
,	O
sardines	B-A
with	I-A

(the	O

and	O
freshest	O
I've	O
ever	O
had).	O

This	O
is	O
where	O
the	O
aforementioned	O
line	O
was.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
reliable	O
and	O
the	O
price	B-A
	O
is	O
moderate.	O

with	O
the	O
NYU	O
student	O
he's	O

you	O
see	O
a	O
strange	O
mix	O
of	O
hipsters,	O
frat	O
boys,	O
Will	O
Smith	O
types	O
who	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
told	O
they	O
are	O
black,	O
bitter	O
cougars	O
who	O
cant	O
understand	O
why	O
they	O

While	O
the	O
ambiance	B-A
	O
and	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
were	O
great,	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
service	B-A
	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
lot	O
better.	O

We	O
always	O
go	O
there	O
on	O
the	O
weekends	O
and	O
leave	O
extremely	O
full	O
and	O
satisfied.	O

i	O
dont	O
how	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
still	O
running.	O

The	O
server	B-A
	O
was	O
really	O
cool	O
and	O
served	B-A
	O
us	O
our	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
drinks	B-A
	O
with	O
a	O
smile.	O

We	O
were	O
in	O
search	O
of	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
stumbled	O
on	O
this	O
block	O
of	O
Indian	O
restaurants	O
on	O
East	O
Sixth	O
Street.	O

Planet	O
Thailand	O
has	O
always	O
been	O
a	O
hit	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
go	O
there	O
usually	O
for	O
the	O
sushi	B-A
,	O
which	O
is	O
great	O
,	O
the	O
thai	B-A
food	I-A
	O
is	O
excellent	O
too	O
.	O

Very	O
excited	O
to	O
hear	O
that	O
short-term	O
Chef	B-A
	O
Jason	O
Narone	O
has	O
moved	O
on,	O
he	O
truly	O
was	O
a	O
low	O
point	O
of	O
their	O
Sterling	O
track	O
record.	O

Excellent	O
experience.	O

Well	O
worth	O
the	O
trip,	O
close	O
to	O
City	O
Hall	O
and	O
downtown	O
subway	O
stops.	O

I	O
had	O
to	O
share	O
my	O
table	B-A
	O
with	O
a	O
loud	O
group	O
of	O
kids	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
rude	O
an	O
unattentive.	O

What	O
more	O
could	O
you	O
want?	O

If	O
you	O
are	O
the	O
type	O
of	O
person	O
who	O
likes	O
being	O
scared	O
and	O
entertained,	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
place	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
eat.	O

All	O
in	O
all,	O
I	O
don't	O
see	O
how	O
you	O
can	O
go	O
wrong.	O

The	O
sauce	B-A
on	I-A
the	I-A
pizza	I-A
	O
is	O
sooo	O
good	O
with	O
garlic	B-A
	O
and	O
fresh	B-A
tomatoes	I-A
	O
and	O
they	O
don't	O
skimp.	O

We	O
recently	O
decided	O
to	O
try	O
this	O
location,	O
and	O
to	O
our	O
delight,	O
they	O
have	O
outdoor	B-A
seating	I-A
,	O
perfect	O
since	O
I	O
had	O
my	O
yorkie	O
with	O
me.	O

My	O
husband	O
had	O
the	O
mesclun	B-A
,	O
salmon	B-A
,	O
and	O
ice	B-A
cream	I-A
	O
and	O
he	O
enjoyed	O
all	O
3	O
courses	B-A
.	O

We	O
were	O
told	O
that	O
the	O
wait	B-A
	O
was	O
about	O
twenty	O
minutes	O
and	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
no	O
problem	O
for	O
our	O
8:00	O
pm	O
curtain	O
call.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
usually	O
good	O
but	O
it	O
certainly	O
isn't	O
a	O
relaxing	O
place	B-A
	O
to	O
go.	O

I'm	O
told	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
open	O
24hrs	O
which	O
is	O
good.	O

Super	O
friendly	O
and	O
knowledgable	O
staff	B-A
,	O
fabulous	O
bistro	B-A
fare	I-A
	O
and	O
a	O
wonderful	O
jazz	B-A
brunch	I-A
	O
with	O
great	O
live	B-A
jazz	I-A
	O
(the	O
chilaquiles	B-A
	O
were	O
awesome!	O

The	O
prices	B-A
	O
were	O
fantastic.	O

What	O
a	O
great	O
place!	O

Still,	O
any	O
quibbles	O
about	O
the	O
bill	B-A
	O
were	O
off-set	O
by	O
the	O
pour-your-own	O
measures	B-A
of	I-A
liquers	I-A
	O
which	O
were	O
courtesey	O
of	O
the	O
house...	O

The	O
table	B-A
service	I-A
	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
attentive	O
but	O
as	O
someone	O
who	O
also	O
works	O
in	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
industry,	O
I	O
understood	O
they	O
were	O
busy.	O

It's	O
not	O
mind-blowing,	O
but	O
to	O
me,	O
thai	B-A
food	I-A
	O
never	O
is	O
and	O
never	O
will	O
be.	O

Food	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
as	O
well,	O
considering	O
that	O
we	O
tried	O
the	O
budget	O
selection	O
(though	O
I	O
wish	O
the	O
pork	B-A
belly	I-A
	O
that	O
I	O
ordered	O
was	O
roasted	O
a	O
bit	O
longer,	O
so	O
that	O
fat	B-A
	O
was	O
more	O
of	O
a	O
melt-in-your-mouth	O
experience).	O

Although,	O
one	O
night	O
we	O
went	O
it	O
was	O
super	O
cheesy,	O
and	O
another	O
night	O
it	O
was	O
less	O
cheesy.	O

Even	O
though	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
loud,	O
you	O
don't	O
have	O
to	O
yell	O
at	O
each	O
other	O
to	O
talk.	O

i've	O
been	O
to	O
sapphire	O
twice	O
and	O
both	O
times	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
fine,	O
if	O
not	O
good.	O

It	O
is	O
kinda	O
nosiy	O
and	O
the	O
tables	B-A
	O
are	O
close	O
together	O
but	O
it's	O
still	O
a	O
beautiful	O
place	B-A
	O
to	O
enjoy	O
a	O
nice	O
dinner	B-A
.	O

Was	O
surprisingly	O
disappointed.	O

I	O
love	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
pizza	B-A
	O
tastes	O
so	O
good	O
and	O
is	O
so	O
cheap.	O

Nicky	O
the	O
Nose	O
at	O
the	O
bar	B-A
	O
is	O
a	O
treat.	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
Ruby	O
Foo's	O
after	O
work	O
with	O
a	O
group	O
of	O
6.	O

I'm	O
amazed	O
we	O
haven't	O
been	O
kicked	O
out	O
of	O
this	O
place	O
yet.	O

Service	B-A
	O
was	O
prompt,	O
friendly	O
and	O
great.	O

I	O
haven't	O
eat	O
a	O
lamb	B-A

The	O

awful!	O

over	O
100	O
years.	O

You	O

	O
at	O

The	O
Pastrami	B-A

	O
and	O
an	O
icy	O
cold	O
beer	B-A
	O

it	O
was	O
a	O

After	O
all	O
that,	O
they	O
complained	O
to	O
me	O
about	O
the	O

It's	O
a	O

to	O

Our	O

sweet	O
and	O
accomodating,	O
not	O

Went	O

I	O
was	O

not	O
to	O
go	O
eat	O
or	O
even	O
take	O
out	O

this	O

	O
look	O
wonderful	O
but	O
in	O
reality	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
disappointing.	O

Despite	O

everything	O

done	O
to	O

For	O
many	O
people,	O
this	O
may	O
not	O
seem	O
like	O
Aunthentic	O
Thai	B-A
food	I-A
	O
because	O
most	O
places	O
in	O
NYC	O
arent	O
quite	O
authentic.	O

Growing	O
up	O
in	O
NY,	O
I	O
have	O
eaten	O
my	O

Oh,	O
don't	O
even	O
let	O
me	O
start	O
with	O
how	O
expensive	O
the	O
bills	B-A
	O
were!	O

A	O
hearty	O
two	O
thumbs	O
up!	O

The	O
scallion	B-A
pancakes	I-A
	O
and	O
fried	B-A
dumplings	I-A
	O
were	O
nothing	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ordinary.	O

All	O
the	O
appetizers	B-A
	O
and	O
salads	B-A
	O
were	O
fabulous,	O
the	O
steak	B-A
	O
was	O
mouth	O
watering	O
and	O
the	O
pasta	B-A
	O
was	O
delicious!!!	O

Besides	O
having	O
the	O
table	B-A
	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
promised	O
given	O
to	O
other	O
restaurant	O
patrons	O
twice	O
before	O
we	O
were	O
actually	O
seated,	O
we	O
were	O
served	B-A
	O
dishes	B-A
	O
we	O
hadn't	O
ordered	O
three	O
times,	O
received	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
orders	O
20	O
minutes	O
after	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
table	B-A
	O
had	O
been	O
served	B-A
	O
(and	O
that	O
order	O
was	O
undercooked),	O
and	O
charged	O
$45	O
more	O
than	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
on	O
our	O
bill	B-A
.	O

Service	B-A
	O
is	O
top	O
notch.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
now	O
is	O
inconsistent.	O

All	O
pretty	O
good.	O

You	O
can	O
also	O
special	O
order	O
any	O
kind	O
of	O
dumpling	B-A
,etc.	O

you	O
guys	O
rock.	O

Chance	O
is	O
a	O
joke.	O

I	O
was	O
pretty	O
much	O
full	O
after	O
our	O

BE	O
CAREFUL	O
before	O
you	O

The	O
octopus	O
eaters	O
were	O
floored	O
by	O
the	O
Octopus	B-A
salad	I-A
.	O

We	O
thought	O
that	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
using	O
too	O
much	O
of	O
MSG	B-A
cooking	I-A
	O
in	O
the	O
foods	B-A
.	O

I	O
was	O
at	O
Rao's	O
last	O
Wed.	O

And	O
the	O
Tom	B-A
Kha	I-A
soup	I-A
	O
was	O
pathetic.	O

I	O
started	O
out	O
with	O
a	O
Bombay	B-A
beer	I-A
	O
which	O
was	O
big	O
enough	O
for	O
two.	O

The	O
decor	B-A
	O
is	O
vibrant	O
and	O
eye-pleasing	O
with	O
several	O
semi-private	B-A
boths	I-A
	O
on	O
the	O
right	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
dining	B-A
hall	I-A
,	O
which	O
are	O
great	O
for	O
a	O
date.	O

Service	B-A
	O
was	O
quick.	O

Tends	O
to	O
turn	O
people	O
away.	O

We	O
thought	O
this	O
a	O
prelude	O
to	O
what	O
the	O
evening	O
will	O
be	O
like.	O

I	O
was	O
turned	O
on	O
to	O
this	O
restaurant	O
by	O
a	O
fellow	O
foodie	O
friend	O
of	O
mine,	O
and	O
have	O
been	O
going	O
back	O
regularly	O
ever	O
since.	O

Drawbacks:	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
slow	O
and	O
they	O
don't	O
toast!	O

Went	O
there	O
for	O
an	O
office	B-A
lunch	I-A
.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
doing	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
above	O
at	O
the	O
Heartland	O
Brewery	O
for	O
over	O
5	O
years	O
now	O
and	O
I	O
HAVE	O
NEVER	O
BEEN	O
DISAPPOINTED!	O

Everytime	O
I	O
decide	O
to	O
try	O
another	O
place	O
on	O
the	O
UES,	O
I	O
get	O
angry	O
that	O
I	O
didn't	O
just	O
go	O
to	O
Zucchero	O
Pomodori.	O

The	O
sweet	B-A
lassi	I-A
	O
was	O
excellent	O
as	O
was	O
the	O
lamb	B-A
chettinad	I-A
	O
and	O
the	O
garlic	B-A
naan	I-A
	O
but	O
the	O
rasamalai	B-A
	O
was	O
forgettable.	O

We've	O
been	O
following	O

	O
have	O
made	O
us	O

The	O
best	O
thing	O
I	O
tasted	O
were	O
the	O

delicious!	O

The	O
spicy	B-A
tuna	I-A
	O
and	O
salmon	B-A
	O
are	O
the	O
best	O
we've	O
ever	O
had.	O

Even	O
though	O
its	O
good	O
seafood	B-A
,	O
the	O
prices	B-A
	O
are	O
too	O
high.	O

In	O
addition,	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
prices	B-A
	O
are	O
reasonable.	O

Upon	O
entering,	O
we	O
were	O
greeted	O
by	O
the	O
owners	B-A
,	O
Steven	O
and	O
Frederick,	O
who	O
went	O
out	O
of	O
their	O

to	O
be	O
more	O
than	O
gracious	O

If	O
you	O
live	O
outside	O
the	O

don't	O
bother!	O

Been	O

absolutely	O
unnecessary!	O

However	O
it	O
is	O
the	O

Our	O
friends	O
have	O
not	O

They	O
came	O
out	O
over	O
cooked	O
and	O
the	O
cheese	B-A
	O
was	O
almost	O
non	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
terrific	O
meal	B-A
,	O
and	O
our	O
server	B-A
	O
guided	O
us	O
toward	O
a	O
very	O
nice	O
wine	B-A
	O
in	O
our	O
price	B-A
range	I-A
,	O
instead	O
of	O
allowing	O
us	O
to	O
purchase	O
a	O
similarly	O
priced	B-A
	O
wine	B-A
	O
that	O
wasn't	O
as	O
good.	O

The	O
svc	B-A
	O
can	O
be	O
a	O
bit	O
rude	O
at	O
times,	O
esp	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
big	O
group,	O
but	O
overall	O
the	O
restaurant	O
is	O
a	O
must!	O

My	O
husband	O
and	O
I	O
thougt	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
great	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
Jekyll	O
and	O
Hyde	O
Pub	O
for	O
our	O
anniversary,	O
and	O
to	O
our	O
surprise	O
it	O
was	O
fantastic.	O

Never	O
once	O
did	O
I	O
leave	O
feeling	O
unwelcome	O
or	O
impressed.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
good,	O
especially	O
their	O
more	O
basic	O
dishes	B-A
,	O
and	O
the	O
drinks	B-A
	O
are	O
delicious.	O

But	O
the	O
main	O
hit	O
was	O
the	O
whole	B-A

I	O
had	O
the	O

	O
with	O
a	O
dessert	B-A
wine	I-A
	O
for	O
$49.	O

On	O
a	O
hot	O
day	O
it	O
was	O
fabulous	O
to	O
stop	O
in	O
and	O
enjoy	O
lunch	B-A
.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
delicious	O
and	O
beautifully	O
prepared	O
along	O
with	O
the	O
friendly	O
and	O
personable	O
service	B-A

I	O
usually	O
go	O
there	O
later	O
at	O
night	O
when	O
I	O
get	O
off	O

so	O
I	O
don't	O
have	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
crowds	B-A
	O
or	O
lines	B-A

Pizza	B-A
	O
here	O

good.	O

We	O

	O
and	O
ar	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
just	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
looking	O
for.	O

After	O
2	O
tries	O
by	O
the	O

	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
away	O
(we	O
hadn't	O

the	O

and	O
told	O
us	O
they	O
needed	O
the	O

Wouldn't	O
recomend	O
it	O
for	O

Sauce	B-A

the	O

My	O

But	O
after	O

Spice	O

the	O
only	O
place	O
I'm	O
eating	O
indian	B-A

We	O
both	O
opted	O
for	O
a	O
pasta	B-A
dish	I-A
	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
served	B-A
	O
timely	O
and	O
fresh.	O

First	O
the	O
wrong	O
bread	B-A
	O
came	O
out	O
with	O
the	O

Not	O

Saul	O
is	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
neighborhood	B-A

and	O
has	O
great	O
food	B-A
!	O

In	O
an	O
area	O
sadly	O
lacking	O
in	O
decent	O
Thai	B-A
food	I-A
,	O
this	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
spots.	O

Tell	O
them	O
Herky	O
sent	O
you	O
and	O
get	O
a	O
free	O
confused	O
look	O
from	O
the	O

Make	O
reservations	B-A
	O
but	O
expect	O
to	O
be	O
delayed	O
15-20	O
minutes	O
as	O
the	O
hosting	B-A
staff	I-A
	O
was	O
having	O
difficulty	O
seating	B-A
	O
guests	O
who	O
arrived	O
with	O
a	O
reservation	B-A
	O
because	O
they	O
probably	O
had	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
walk	O
ins	O
being	O
so	O
close	O
to	O
Time	O
Square.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
average	O
or	O
above	O
including	O
some	O
surprising	O
tasty	O
dishes	B-A
.	O

They	O
don't	O
seem	O
to	O
place	O
an	O
emphasis	O
on	O
specials	B-A
	O
or	O
fresh	O
ingredients	B-A
	O
which	O
to	O
me	O
is	O
necessary	O
for	O
good	O
thai	B-A
.	O

Other	O
apetizers	B-A
	O
and	O
food	B-A
	O

The	O
noodle	B-A
and	I-A
rices	I-A
dishes	I-A
	O
taste	O
great.	O

The	O
food	B-A
's	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
ever.	O

The	O
crust	B-A
	O
is	O
thin,	O
the	O
ingredients	B-A
	O
are	O
fresh	O
and	O
the	O
staff	B-A
	O
is	O
friendly.	O

Your	O
friends	O
will	O
thank	O
you	O
for	O
introducing	O
them	O
to	O
this	O
gem!	O

Also	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
expensive	O
than	O
your	O
average	O
bagel	B-A
	O
place.	O

the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
undercooked-the	O
sauce	B-A
	O
watery,	O
and	O
the	O
vegetables	B-A
	O
raw.	O

And	O
the	O
fried	B-A
clams	I-A
	O
had	O
just	O
enough	O
kick	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
make	O
'em	O
worth	O
eating.	O

The	O
sauces	B-A
	O
used	O
are	O
also	O
not	O
that	O
exciting.	O

The	O
secret	O
is	O
the	O
lunch	B-A
menu	I-A
	O
which	O
offers	O
a	O
complimentary	O
appetizer	B-A
	O
with	O
every	O
entree	B-A
	O
ordered.	O

I	O
absolutely	O
love	O
this	O
place!!!	O

The	O
rice	B-A
	O
was	O
poor	O
quality	B-A
	O
and	O
was	O
cooked	B-A
	O
so	O
badly	O
it	O
was	O
hard.	O

We	O
had	O
champagne	B-A
	O
and	O
caviar	B-A
	O
and	O
felt	O
like	O
princesses!	O

The	O
shrimp	B-A
scampi	I-A
	O
was	O
excellent	O
and	O
the	O
antipasti	B-A
	O
were	O
plentiful.	O

I	O
am	O
surprised	O
to	O
say	O
the	O
least	O
and	O
find	O
such	O
practice	O
not	O
worth	O
the	O
effort.	O

When	O
my	O
dessert	B-A
	O
came,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
candle	O
in	O
it	O
-	O
not	O
because	O
anyone	O
asked	O
for	O
one	O
-	O
but	O
because	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
	O
must	O
have	O
seen	O
me	O
opening	O
my	O
birthday	O
card	O
and	O
gift,	O
and	O
said	O
he	O
knew	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
special	O
occassion	O
of	O
some	O
sort.	O

I	O
got	O
the	O
$10	O
10-piece	O
dim	B-A
sum	I-A
combo	I-A
,	O
every	O
bite	O
of	O
which	O
was	O
great.	O

There	O
are	O
other	O
Vietnamese	O
restaurants	O
in	O
the	O
chinatown	O
area	O
and	O
you	O
can	O
forget	O
about	O
those.	O

There	O
is	O
also	O
very	O
limited	O
seating	B-A
	O
and	O
there	O
can	O
be	O
a	O
substantial	O
wait	B-A
	O
in	O
getting	O
food	B-A
	O
at	O
peak	O
times.	O

If	O
it's	O
just	O
a	O
quick	O
martini	B-A
	O
at	O
the	O
bar	B-A
	O
(which	O
I	O
recommend	O
Jeffery's)	O
or	O
a	O
mind	O
blowing	O
Roast	B-A
Chicken	I-A
,	O
go	O
to	O
Village!	O

No	O
thanks!!!	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
long	O
wait	B-A
	O
for	O
a	O
table	B-A
	O
outside,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
too	O
hot	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
anyway	O
so	O
our	O
insde	B-A
table	I-A
	O
was	O
very	O
nice.	O

I	O
would	O
definently	O
recommend	O
this	O
restaurant.	O

The	O
prices	B-A
	O
are	O
wonderfully	O
low.	O

If	O
you	O
like	O
spicy	B-A

THIS	O

I	O

lays	O
in	O
their	O
amazingly	O
delicious	O
and	O
cheap	O
lunch	B-A
specials	I-A

So	O
much	O
more	O
than	O
the	O
usual	O
bar	B-A
food	I-A
,	O
go	O
there	O
to	O
enjoy	O
the	O
menu	B-A
	O
while	O
sampling	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
hand-crafted	B-A

A	O
big	O
disappointment,	O
all	O
around.	O

And	O
its	O
absolutely	O
DELICIOUS.	O

No	O
free	O
drink	B-A
.	O

I	O
would	O
say	O
that	O
all	O
was	O
fine	O
and	O
tasty	O
but	O
the	O
heaviness	O
on	O
my	O
stomach	O
someting	O
that	O
i	O
can't	O
not	O
mention	O
or	O
undermine.	O

This	O
is	O
my	O
first	O

for	O
a	O

because	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
excellent.	O

Definitely	O
Highly	O
NOT	O
recommended.	O

While	O
they	O
keep	O
the	O
capex	B-A
	O
to	O
a	O
minimum,	O
they	O
do	O
put	O
some	O
cash	O
into	O
the	O
bagels	B-A
,	O
because	O
they	O
among	O
the	O
best	O
in	O
the	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
huge	O
group	O

we	O

this	O

I'd	O

an	O

my	O
first	O
time	O
here	O
was	O
with	O
my	O

I	O
pray	O
it	O
stays	O
open	O
forever.	O

Each	O
bite	O
of	O

	O
at	O
Kai	O
was	O
indeed	O
delicious,	O
fresh,	O
and	O
elegant.	O

all	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O

the	O
quality	B-A
of	I-A
food	I-A
	O
in	O
most	O
moderately	O

	O
restaurants	O
is	O
mediocre	O
this	O
was	O
slightly	O
more	O

it.	O

If	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
save	O

My	O

The	O

it's	O
in	O

The	O

If	O

unfortunately	O
-	O
the	O

,	O
sorry	O
-	O
not	O
the	O

in	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
amazing!!!!	O

Having	O
not	O
been	O
home	O
in	O
the	O
last	O
2	O
years	O
may	O
skew	O
this	O
reviewer	O
a	O
bit,	O
but	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
tasty	O
and	O
spicy	O
sans	O
the	O
oil	B-A
	O
that	O
comes	O
floating	O
along	O
at	O
similar	O
venues.	O

The	O
portions	B-A
	O
are	O
now	O
very	O
small,	O
the	O
sauces	B-A
	O
are	O
overly-ambitious	O
usually	O
inedible	O
while	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
still	O
good,	O
the	O
restaurant,	O
due	O
to	O
its	O
popularity,	O
seems	O
frantic.	O

For	O
the	O
price	B-A
,	O
you	O
cannot	O
eat	O
this	O
well	O
in	O
Manhattan.	O

The	O
owner	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
friendly	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
guy,	O
go	O
try	O
his	O
pizza	B-A
,	O
you'll	O
like	O
it!	O

The	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
is	O

It	O
can	O

a	O
very	O

experience	O
with	O
a	O
group,	O
and	O
kids	O
(6	O

would	O
love	O
it.	O

With	O
so	O
many	O
good	O
restaurants	O
on	O
the	O
UWS,	O
I	O
don't	O
need	O
overpriced	O
food	B-A
,	O
absurdly	O
arrogant	O
wait-staff	B-A
	O
who	O
don't	O
recognize	O
they	O
work	O
at	O
a	O
glorified	O
diner	B-A
,	O
clumsy	O
service	B-A
,	O
and	O
management	B-A
	O
that	O
doesn't	O
care.	O

I	O
tend	O
to	O
judge	O
a	O
sushi	O
restaurant	O
by	O
its	O
sea	B-A
urchin	I-A
,	O
which	O
was	O
heavenly	O
at	O
sushi	O
rose.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
scatty	O
at	O
times	O
but	O
all	O
is	O
forgiven	O
when	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
arrives.	O

The	O
bruscetta	B-A
	O
is	O
a	O
bit	O
soggy,	O
but	O
the	O
salads	B-A
	O
were	O
fresh,	O
included	O
a	O
nice	O
mix	B-A
of	I-A
greens	I-A
	O
(not	O
iceberg	B-A
)	O
all	O
dishes	B-A
	O
are	O
served	B-A
	O
piping	O
hot	O
from	O
the	O
kitchen.	O

And	O
evaluated	O
on	O
those	O
terms	O
Pastis	O
is	O
simply	O
wonderful.	O

The	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
isn't	O
the	O
greatest	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
suppose	O
that's	O
how	O
they	O
keep	O
the	O
prices	B-A
	O
down	O
.	O

The	O
pickles	B-A
	O
were	O
great	O
addition.	O

If	O
your	O

then	O
this	O

your	O

You	O

Not	O

is	O
the	O

	O
the	O

around,	O
the	O

	O
has	O
always	O
been	O
attentive	O
and	O
charming.	O

Filled	O
with	O

though,	O
so	O
you	O
never	O
really	O

The	O

is	O
a	O

of	O

to	O

	O
sublime	O
for	O
the	O

my	O

	O
is	O
expensive	O

it's	O

It's	O
like	O
you	O
are	O
transported	O
to	O
the	O
Italian	O
countryside,	O
very	O
romantic	O
and	O
filled	O
with	O

The	O
cold	B-A
appetizer	I-A

I	O
remember	O
them	O
to	O
taste	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
growing	O
up	O
in	O
Taiwan.	O

Just	O
go	O
and	O
see	O
for	O
yourself.	O

The	O
restaurant	O
was	O
packed	O
at	O
first,	O
so	O
we	O
waited	O
at	O
the	O
bar	B-A
	O
for	O
about	O
20	O
minutes	O
before	O
we	O
were	O
seated.	O

I	O

Any	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
reservation	B-A
	O
you'll	O
wait	O
for	O
max	O
5	O
minutes	O
-	O
so	O
have	O
a	O
drink	B-A
	O
at	O
the	O
bar	B-A
.	O

Whether	O
it's	O
the	O
parmesean	B-A

	O
or	O
the	O
lamb	B-A
glazed	I-A
with	I-A

,	O
you	O
will	O
surely	O
be	O
transported	O
to	O
Northern	O
Italy	O
with	O
one	O
bite.	O

That	O
place	O
was	O
awesome,,,	O
sally	O
!	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
'gourmet'	B-A
Indian	I-A
cuisine	I-A
.	O

Finally	O
a	O
reliable	O
Chinese	O
restaurant!	O

get	O
over	O
it!	O

But	O
the	O
thing	O
that	O
my	O
wife	O
and	O
I	O
hated	O
was	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
loud	O
and	O
it	O
felt	O
like	O
'bar	B-A
'	O
or	O
'pub	B-A
'.	O

However,	O
it	O
just	O
so	O
happens	O
that	O
there's	O
an	O
even	O
more	O
amazing	O
place	O
just	O
down	O
the	O
street.	O

While	O
there	O
are	O
plenty	O
of	O
places	O
to	O
go	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
corned	B-A
beef	I-A
sandwich	I-A
,	O
Katz's	O
has	O
a	O
charm	O
about	O
it.	O

However,	O
looking	O
at	O
the	O
table	O
next	O
to	O
ours,	O
we	O
both	O
sort	O
of	O
wished	O
we	O
had	O
ordered	O
pizza	B-A
,	O
which	O
looked	O
PERRRRRRRRRFECT.	O

Priced	B-A
	O
at	O
upper	O
intermediate	O
range.	O

The	O
fish	B-A
	O
was	O
adequate,	O
but	O
inexpertly	O
sliced.	O

I	O
recommend	O
ordering	O
in	O
on	O
a	O
weeknight.	O

If	O
you	O
live	O
in	O
new	O
york	O
city,	O
you'll	O
find	O
better	O
food	B-A
	O
at	O
small	O
restaurants	O
outside	O
of	O
time	O
square	O
and	O
spend	O
half	O
the	O
amount	B-A
.	O

Try	O
the	O
olive	B-A
cream	I-A

	O
or	O
the	O

While	O
it's	O
not	O
Nobu,	O
it	O
sure	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
and	O
you	O
definitely	O
will	O
leave	O
feeling	O
satisfied	O
and	O
full.	O

So	O
my	O
husband	O
made	O
up	O
an	O
excuse	O
so	O
we	O
can	O
leave.	O

It's	O
very	O
spicy	O
but	O
not	O
offensive.	O

they	O
didn't	O
disappoint,	O
service	B-A
	O
from	O
the	O
second	O
i	O
arrived	O
at	O
the	O

was	O
extremely	O
pleasant	O
and	O
attentive	O
with	O
almost	O
one	O
server	B-A
	O
per	O
table	B-A
.	O

I	O
don't	O
know	O
who	O
they	O
think	O
they	O
are	O
but	O
they	O
have	O
no	O
respect	O
for	O
the	O
residents	O
of	O
the	O

ever	O
since	O
they	O
opened	O

the	O

They	O
used	O
shredded	B-A
cheese	I-A
	O
on	O
top!	O

They	O
are	O
located	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
Chinatown!	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
great	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
good	O
selecion	B-A
of	I-A

	O
at	O
reasonable	O

Eating	O
at	O
Ottimo	O
is	O
like	O
eating	O
in	O
Chef	O
Salvatore	O
Esposito's	O
home.	O

Katz's	O
deli	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
NY	O
experience.	O

Check	O
it	O
out.	O

The	O
only	O
positive	O
was	O
the	O

which	O

likeable.	O

I	O
couldn't	O

I	O
am	O
not	O
a	O
vegetarian	O
but,	O
almost	O
all	O
the	O
dishes	B-A
	O
were	O
great.	O

I	O
was	O
very	O
impressed	O
by	O
this	O
low-key	O
upper	O

and	O
their	O
authentically	O
thai	B-A
cuisine	I-A
!!!	O

i	O
would	O
go	O
again	O
if	O
i	O
didn't	O
have	O
to	O
pay.	O

For	O
the	O
location	B-A
,	O
the	O
prices	B-A
	O
are	O
very	O
reasonable.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
okay	O
and	O
the	O
prices	B-A
	O
here	O
are	O
mediocre.	O

My	O
friend's	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
also	O
the	O
complete	O
opposite	O
of	O
what	O
it's	O
supposed	O
to	O
taste	O
like	O
(aND	O
look	O
like).	O

I	O
ordered	O
the	O
crab	B-A
cocktail	I-A
	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
soaked	O
in	O
a	O
lime	B-A

concoction	I-A
	O
where	O
all	O
you	O
could	O
taste	O
was	O
the	O

I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O

	O
when	O
I	O

at	O

drinking	O

from	O

We	O
got	O
a	O
little	O
tipsy	O
from	O
the	O

	O
but	O
isn't	O
that	O
what	O
Saturday	O
nights	O
with	O
the	O
girlfriends	O
are	O
all	O
about?	O

I	O
almost	O
wanted	O
to	O
write	O
a	O
bad	O
review,	O
so	O
no	O
one	O
would	O
ever	O
go	O
here	O
and	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
all	O
the	O
dumplings	B-A
	O
to	O
myself!	O

After	O
reading	O
the	O

I	O
was	O
always	O
skeptical	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
The	O
Minnow,	O
despite	O
living	O
in	O
Park	O
Slope.	O

I	O
loved	O
it	O
and	O
will	O
be	O
back	O
soon.	O

Always	O
a	O
nice	O
crowd	B-A
,	O
but	O
never	O
loud.	O

My	O
turkey	B-A

	O
was	O
not	O
cooked	O
at	O
all,	O
my	O
friends	O
salmon	B-A
	O
was	O
completely	O
raw.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
spotty,	O
sometimes	O
really	O
friendly	O
and	O
sometimes	O
barely	O
there.	O

Decor	B-A
	O
is	O
minimalist	O
and	O
clean	O
-	O
nothing	O
to	O
distract	O
or	O
commend.	O

His	O

	O
especially	O
the	O
Margheritta	B-A

This	O
place	B-A
,	O
however,	O
has	O
a	O
lot	O
less	O
pretension	O
than	O
Joya	O
and	O
the	O
Thai	B-A
food	I-A
	O
is	O
still	O
above-average.	O

My	O

and	O
I	O
ate	O

We	O
started	O
with	O
lox	B-A
	O
and	O
mussels	B-A
	O
(the	O
best	O
ive	O
ever	O
had,	O
ever)	O
and	O
had	O
the	O
cod	B-A
	O
and	O

	O
for	O
dinner	B-A
.	O

The	O
crispy	B-A
chicken	I-A
	O
wasn't	O
for	O
us,	O
though.	O

JUST	O
AWSOME.	O

Food	B-A
	O
is	O
great.	O

There	O
is	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
variety	O
even	O
for	O
people	O
who	O
eat	O
vegetarian	O
like	O
me.	O

I	O
recommend	O
the	O
meatballs	B-A
	O
and	O
caprese	B-A
salad	I-A
	O
and	O
the	O
beans	B-A
on	I-A
toast	I-A
	O
were	O
a	O
wonderful	O
start	O
to	O
the	O
meal	B-A
!	O

This	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
incredibly	O
tiny.	O

I	O
will	O
definetely	O
go	O
back	O
again	O
and	O
again,	O
that's	O
for	O
sure!!!	O

I	O
didn't	O
complain,	O
I	O
liked	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
so	O
much.	O

This	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
all-time	O
favorite.	O

In	O
reality	O
(to	O
maximize	O
potential	O
diners	B-A
)	O
they	O
were	O
still	O
taking	O
phone	O
reservations	B-A
	O
and	O
reallocating	O
tables	B-A
	O
of	O
those	O
waiting	B-A
	O
in	O
the	O
lobby	B-A
.	O

The	O
wine	B-A
	O
is	O
always	O
good,	O
the	O
tapas	B-A
	O
are	O
always	O
yummy,	O
especially	O
with	O
the	O
warm	O
pita	B-A
bread	I-A
.	O

But	O
when	O
you	O
are	O
seated	O
the	O
waitresses	B-A
	O
are	O
great,	O
they	O
explain	O
everything	O
on	O
the	O
menu	B-A
,	O
and	O
the	O
price	B-A
	O
of	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
really	O
cheap	O
for	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
you	O
get.	O

this	O
place	O
is	O
amazingly	O
bad.	O

Compared	O
to	O
other	O
shabu	O
restaurants	O
around	O
town,	O
this	O
places	O
wins	O
hands-down.	O

I've	O
been	O
to	O
several	O
places	O
for	O
Dim	B-A
Sum	I-A
	O
and	O
this	O
has	O
got	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
WORST.	O

I	O
love	O
this	O
place.	O

The	O
freshest,	O
best	O
variety	B-A
,	O
and	O
the	O
fastest	O
delivery	B-A
.	O

Go	O
to	O
Volare	O
for	O
1st	O
class	O
service	B-A
	O
and	O
terrific	O
food	B-A
.	O

It's	O
super-trendy	O
and	O
there's	O
always	O
someone	O
to	O
take	O
that	O
empty	O
seat	B-A
,	O
so	O
it	O
seems	O
that	O
customer	O
service	B-A
	O
has	O
been	O
deemed	O
not	O
of	O
the	O
essence.	O

Dinner	B-A
	O
took	O
almost	O
4	O
hours	O
without	O
any	O
lag	O
time.	O

The	O
people	B-A
	O
in	O
the	O
restaurant	O
were	O
pretty	O
obnoxious	O
and	O
loud.	O

The	O
sandwiches	B-A
	O
are	O
dry,	O
tasteless	O
and	O
way	O
overpriced.	O

The	O
problem	O
is	O
just	O
that-it	O
is	O
a	O
sometimes	O
kind	O
of	O
affair.	O

Price	B-A
	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
Jersey	O
deli	O
but	O
way	O
better.	O

The	O
fried	B-A
rice	I-A
	O
is	O
really	O
good	O
too.	O

We	O
were	O
well	O
attended	O
to	O
by	O
the	O
enthusiastic	O
staff	B-A
	O
especially	O
the	O
manager	B-A
	O
Tony	O
Gaskin	O
who	O
made	O
excellent	O
suggestions	O
for	O
our	O
menu	B-A
selections	I-A
.	O

Made	O
my	O
dining	B-A
experience	I-A
	O
uncomfortable.	O

It's	O
a	O
steal!	O

We	O
went	O
to	O
this	O
restaurant	O
based	O
on	O
prior	O

we	O
were	O

	O
which	O
is	O

by	O

I	O
was	O
very	O
disappointed	O
with	O
this	O

The	O

made	O
and	O

We	O
also	O
had	O
shared	O
a	O

that	O
was	O

The	O

My	O
wife	O
and	O
I	O
were	O
in	O
NYC	O
celebrating	O
our	O
30th	O
anniversary.	O

I'm	O
glad	O
I	O
was	O
introduced	O
to	O
this	O
place	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
rare	O
gem	O
in	O
NY.	O

And	O
at	O
the	O
conclusion	O
of	O
this	O
culinary	O
nightmare	O
the	O
check	B-A
	O
was	O
given	O
to	O
our	O
table	B-A
	O
by	O
knocking	O
over	O
a	O
glass	B-A
of	I-A
water	I-A

Not	O
a	O
small	O
feat	O
for	O
good	O
french	B-A
food	I-A
	O
in	O
the	O

The	O
space	B-A
	O
is	O
a	O
bit	O
too	O
small	O
for	O
live	B-A

,	O
so	O
on	O
	O
jazz	B-A
nights	I-A
,	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
loud	O
and	O
cramped.	O

Food	B-A
	O
was	O
average	O
but	O
tasty.	O

We	O

The	O
entree	B-A
	O
was	O
bland	O
and	O
small,	O
dessert	B-A
	O
was	O
not	O

I	O
highly	O
recommend	O
it.	O

Oh	O
and	O
it's	O
too	O
tiny	O
for	O
families	O
with	O
strollers.	O

The	O
staff	B-A
	O
was	O
the	O
friendliest	O
that	O
have	O
seen	O
in	O

With	O
the	O

that	O
had	O
so	O
much	O

on	O

that	O
our	O

started	O
watering,	O
the	O

that	O
the	O

exists	O
and	O
the	O

its	O

Admittedly	O
some	O

there	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O

The	O
waiter	B-A
	O
actually	O
poured	O

	O
on	O
my	O

and	O
walked	O

The	O

quality	B-A

I	O
even	O
took	O
a	O
friend	O
here	O
from	O
Japan	O
who	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O

places	I-A
	O
in	O
the	O
US	O
that	O
he	O
has	O
been	O
to.	O

I	O
brought	O
some	O
buddies	O
from	O
CA	O
and	O
they	O
loved	O
it.	O

Inside	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
cramped,	O
but	O
to	O
be	O
expected.	O

Sushi	B-A
	O
wasn't	O
anything	O
spectacular	O
for	O
the	O
price	B-A
.	O

During	O
our	O
meal	B-A
,	O
the	O
management	B-A
	O
came	O
over	O
and	O
checked	O
on	O
us	O
and	O
even	O
bought	O
us	O
a	O
round	B-A
of	I-A
drinks	I-A
.	O

But	O
they	O
don't	O
have	O
a	O
toaster	B-A
,	O
which	O
is	O
strange.	O

So,	O
for	O
good	O
food	B-A
	O
i'd	O
recommend	O
it,	O
but	O
not	O
for	O
a	O
fun	O
night	O
out.	O

The	O
menu	B-A
choices	I-A
	O
are	O
similar	O
but	O
the	O
taste	B-A
	O
lacked	O
more	O
flavor	B-A
	O
than	O
it	O
looked.	O

A	O
must	O
for	O
all	O
the	O
Dosa	B-A
	O
lovers.	O

The	O
portions	B-A
	O
are	O
HUGE,	O
so	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
good	O
to	O
order	O
three	O
things	O
to	O
split	O
(rather	O
than	O
one	O
appetizer	B-A
	O
and	O
entree	B-A
	O
per	O
person)	O
for	O
two	O
people.	O

The	O
appetizers	B-A
	O
are	O
just	O
OK	O
and	O
the	O
main	B-A
courses	I-A
	O
were	O
decidedly	O
subpar.	O

Someone	O
else	O
recommended	O
the	O
dessert	B-A
	O
-	O
we	O
also	O
left	O
that.	O

The	O
exotic	B-A
food	I-A
	O
is	O
beautifully	O
presented	O
and	O
is	O
a	O
delight	O
in	O
delicious	O
combinations.	O

The	O
staff	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
attentive	O
and	O
we	O
can	O
almost	O
always	O
get	O
a	O
table	B-A
.	O

If	O
you	O
are	O
a	O
vegetarian,	O
this	O
really	O
isn't	O
a	O
good	O
place	O
to	O
go.	O

Try	O
the	O
mediterranean	B-A
salad	I-A
,	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
true	O
experience	O
for	O
your	O
taste	O
buds!!	O

I'm	O
sure	O
I'll	O
return	O
for	O
a	O
final	O
judgement	O
tho.	O

Of	O
course,	O
it	O
is	O
crowded	O
but	O
who	O
cares.	O

This	O
quaint	O
and	O
romantic	O
trattoria	O
is	O
at	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
my	O

I've	O
been	O
there	O
three	O
times	O
and	O
have	O
always	O
had	O
wonderful	O
experiences.	O

People	B-A
	O
are	O
always	O
friendly.	O

The	O
cream	B-A

	O
are	O
out	O
of	O
this	O

and	O
I	O
love	O
that	O
coffee	B-A
!!	O

From	O
the	O
entrees	B-A
	O
to	O
the	O
sides	B-A
	O
to	O
the	O
drinks	B-A
,	O
everything	O
was	O
creatively	O
prepared	O
yet	O
still	O
simple.	O

hmmm.	O

Service	B-A
	O
was	O
prompt	O
and	O
courteous.	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
above	O
ordinary	O
and	O
the	O

Chance	O
is	O
a	O

restaurant,	O
with	O
a	O
romantic	O
feel	O
to	O
it,	O
the	O
decor	B-A
	O
is	O
great.	O

It	O
was	O
nice	O
and	O
fresh,	O
but	O
I	O
can't	O
give	O
it	O
high	O
scores	O
on	O

Overall,	O

When	O
I	O

I	O
didn't	O
think	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
in	O
at	O
12,	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
in,	O
along	O
with	O
four	O
other	O
guests.	O

Got	O
club	B-A

Only	O
wine	B-A
	O

are	O
served	B-A
,	O
but	O
the	O
house	B-A
varities	I-A
	O
are	O
actually	O
quite	O
good.	O

This	O
place	O
must	O
have	O
cost	B-A
	O
the	O
owners	B-A
	O
afortune	O
to	O
build.	O

My	O
mouth	O
starts	O
to	O
water	O
merely	O
thinking	O
about	O
the	O
delight	O
that	O
is	O
this	O
restaurant.	O

I	O
haven't	O
been	O
to	O
the	O

Oh,	O
and	O
the	O
complimentary	O
pudding	B-A
dessert	I-A
	O
was	O
just	O
enough-	O
yummy!	O

People	O
dress	O
in	O
suits	O
or	O
evening	O
gowns	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
shirts	O
jeans.	O

we	O
split	O
a	O
tasty	O
vegetable	B-A
samosa	I-A
	O
and	O
the	O
malai	B-A
tikka	I-A

Knowledge	O
of	O
the	O
chef	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
waitress	B-A
	O
are	O
below	O
average.	O

We	O
were	O
walking	O
around	O
the	O
village	O
and	O
went	O
into	O
this	O
place	O
just	O
for	O
some	O
drinks	B-A
.	O

Decent	O
wine	B-A
selection	I-A
	O
too.	O

Go	O
with	O
a	O
group	O
of	O
friends	O
and	O
you	O
will	O
have	O
a	O
great	O
time.	O

It	O
saves	O
walking	O
in	O
and	O
waiting	B-A
	O
for	O
a	O
table	B-A
	O
in	O
the	O
often	O
noisy,	O
crowded	O
bar	B-A
	O
at	O
dinnertime.	O

I	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
I	O
have	O
never	O
had	O
a	O
disapointing	O
meal	B-A
	O
here.	O

It's	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
favorite	O
places	O
to	O
eat	O
in	O
NY.	O

The	O
place	O
does	O
get	O
crowded,	O
so	O
I	O
recommend	O
going	O
between	O
4-5	O
PM.	O

Mine	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
burnt	O
but	O
still	O
delicious	O
with	O
goat	B-A
cheese	I-A
	O
and	O
panchetta	B-A
	O
(raddichio	B-A
	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
bitter	O
though).	O

Disappointing	O
food	B-A
,	O
lousy	O
service	B-A
.	O

I'm	O
from	O
sichuan,	O
this	O
is	O
the	O

I	O
recommend	O
going.	O

This	O
lovely	O
French-Asian	O
fusion	O
restaurant	O
stands	O
out	O
amongst	O
other	O
great	O
restaurants	O
on	O
Smith	O

If	O
you	O
want	O
a	O
casual	O
neighborhood	O
bistro	O
that	O
has	O
great	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
excellent	O
service	B-A
,	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
place.	O

great	O
place	O
to	O
go	O
for	O
a	O
drink	B-A
	O
too	O
because	O
they	O
have	O
100	O
kinds	B-A
of	I-A
beer	I-A
.	O

But	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
a	O
well-oiled	O
machine	O
so	O
they	O
know	O
what	O
they're	O
doing.	O

Over	O
price	B-A
,	O
and	O
small	O
portions	B-A

Meanwhile,	O
the	O
bartender	B-A
	O
continued	O
to	O
pour	O
champagne	B-A
	O
from	O
his	O
reserve	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
finished	O
our	O
bottle	O
and	O
we	O
enjoyed	O
an	O
amuse	O
of	O
turnip	B-A
soup	I-A
with	I-A
pureed	I-A
basil	I-A
,	O
gratis.	O

But	O
I'd	O
go	O
back	O

Stepped	O
on	O
my	O
foot	O
on	O
the	O
SECOND	O
time	O
he	O
reached	O
over	O
me	O
to	O
adjust	O
lighting.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
well	O
prepared	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
impecable.	O

BUt	O
their	O
best	O
dish	B-A
	O
is	O
thh	O
Thai	B-A
spiced	I-A
curry	I-A
noodles	I-A
with	I-A
shrimp	I-A
	O
-	O
a	O
dish	B-A
	O
that	O
would	O
cost	B-A
	O
$23.95	O
is	O
most	O
places,	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
$16	O
here.	O

Good,	O
dark	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
music	B-A
	O
is	O
a	O
nice	O
touch.	O

My	O
husband	O
said	O
the	O
portions	B-A
	O
were	O
very	O
small,	O
but	O
if	O
my	O
main	B-A
course	I-A
	O
was	O
good	O
to	O
eat	O
the	O
portion	B-A
	O
would've	O
been	O
fine	O
for	O
me.	O

But	O
the	O
thai	B-A
	O
is	O
definitely	O
not	O
great	O
--	O
bland	O
and	O
indistinguished.	O

This	O

restaurant	O
is	O
a	O
couple	O
blocks	O
away	O
from	O
Sripraphai	O
(another	O

Authentic	O

and	O
I	O
cannot	O
recommend	O
a	O
better	O
Shanghai	O
place	O
in	O
New	O

Our	O
friendly	O

	O
made	O

both	O
the	O

Perhaps	O
the	O
last	O
reviewer	O
(who	O
stated	O
she	O
was	O
treated	O
with	O
attitude)	O
lives	O
in	O
a	O
parallel	O
universe	O
because	O
I	O
have	O
never	O
had	O
anything	O
but	O
a	O
perfect	O
experience	O
at	O
Yasuda.	O

That	O
said,	O
I	O
thought	O
Scalini	O
Fedeli	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
dining	O
experiences	O
I've	O
EVER	O
had.	O

Everything	O
about	O
this	O
restaurant	O
was	O
special.	O

Because	O
we	O
didn't	O
have	O
a	O
reservation	B-A
,	O
we	O
could	O
only	O
sit	O
in	O
the	O
back	B-A
garden	I-A
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
great,	O
secluded	O
and	O
perfect	O
in	O
nice	O
weather.	O

Stuffing	O
yourself	O
with	O
Japanese	B-A
food	I-A
	O
is	O
a	O
rare	O
thing.	O

I	O
try	O
my	O
best	O
to	O
give	O
an	O
accurate	O
description	O
of	O
any	O
establishment	O
visited.	O

While	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
good	O
(certainly	O
no	O
Il	O
Mulino)	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
horrendous.	O

It	O
is	O
expensive	O
but	O
well	O
worth	O
the	O
money.	O

Service	B-A
	O
is	O
not	O
what	O
one	O
would	O
expect	O
from	O
a	O
joint	O
in	O
this	O
price	B-A
category	I-A
.	O

Our	O
family	O
never	O
expected	O
such	O
incredible	O
entertainment	B-A
	O
in	O
a	O
restaurant.	O

i	O
would	O
recommend	O
reservations	B-A
	O
on	O
weekends	O
though.	O

There	O
are	O
many	O
Thai	O
places	O
in	O
the	O

so	O
far	O
Toons	O
is	O

Great	O
pizza	B-A
	O
for	O
lunch	O
place.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
expensive	O
(we	O
spent	O
$160	O
for	O
lunch	B-A
	O
for	O
two)	O
but	O
extremely	O
tasty.	O

I	O
don't	O
think	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
again.	O

We	O
were	O
a	O
group	O
of	O
8	O
and	O
well	O
seved	B-A
.	O

And	O
that's	O
no	O
mean	O
feat...	O

I	O
often	O
go	O
there	O
to	O
eat	O
with	O
my	O
family.	O

I	O
wish	O
they	O
would	O
change	O
back	O
to	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
before.	O

I'm	O
no	O

	O
critic,	O

I'd	O

I	O
have	O

experience	O
under	O
my	O
belt	O
having	O
lived	O
in	O
NY	O
for	O
the	O

11	O
years.	O

I	O
noted	O
it	O
was	O
crossed	O
off	O

Needless	O
to	O
say,	O
I'm	O
never	O
going	O

and	O
you	O
should	O
be	O
wary	O
too.	O

Best	O
dish	B-A
	O
is	O
nori-wrapped	B-A
tuna	I-A

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
absolutely	O
amazing!!	O

Some	O

you	O
a	O

the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
slightly	O
disappointing.	O

Mermaid	O
Inn	O
is	O
an	O
overall	O
good	O
restaurant	O
with	O
really	O
good	O
seafood	B-A
.	O

I	O
work	O
around	O
the	O
corner	O
and	O
tried	O
it	O
with	O
a	O
colleague	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time.	O

I	O
went	O
here	O
with	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
and	O
another	O
couple.	O

The	O
staff	B-A
	O
is	O
also	O
attentive	O
and	O
friendly.	O

The	O
all	B-A
you	I-A
can	I-A
eat	I-A
deal	I-A
	O
is	O
truly	O
amazing	O
here.	O

That	O
is	O
a	O
problem	O
since	O
we	O
paid	O
about	O
20	O
bucks	O
a	O
dish	B-A
,	O
and	O
had	O
to	O
order	O
5	O
dishes	B-A
	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
decent	O
taste	B-A
.	O

This	O
is	O
definitely	O
a	O
place	O
that	O
provides	O
the	O
best	O
experience,	O
though,	O
to	O
both	O
A-listers	O
and	O
people	O
walking	O
in	O
off	O
the	O
street.	O

They	O
were	O
such	O
a	O
rip-off	O
($8.95	O
for	O
four	O
small	O
meat	B-A
patties	I-A
in	I-A
steamed	I-A
buns	I-A
)	O
and	O
not	O
worth	O
trying.	O

first	O
it	O
took	O
us	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
place.	O

All	O
of	O
the	O
pizzas	B-A
	O
are	O
terrific	O
and	O
the	O
price	B-A
	O
is	O
even	O
better!	O

It	O
is	O
about	O
FOOD	B-A
	O
and	O
Ambiance	B-A
,	O
and	O
imagine	O
how	O
dreadful	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
it	O
we	O
only	O
had	O
to	O
listen	O
to	O
an	O
idle	O
engine.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
good	O
too.	O

We	O
have	O
tried	O
every	O
Thai	O
restaurant	O
between	O
Atlantic	O
Avenue	O
and	O
4th	O
Streets,	O
and	O
Joya	O
is	O
the	O
best.	O

Immediately	O
after	O
we	O
paid,	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
	O
took	O
the	O
money	O
and	O
said,	O
okay,	O
you	O
guys	O
are	O
outta	O
here.	O

The	O
dining	B-A
room	I-A
	O
is	O
quietly	O
elegant	O
with	O
no	O
music	B-A
	O
to	O
shout	O
over	O
--	O
how	O
refreshing!	O

Admittedly,	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
place	O
for	O
gigantic	O
pieces	O
of	O
fish	B-A
	O
overflowing	O
the	O
plate	O
(and	O
thank	O
goodness,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion)	O
but	O
for	O
simple,	O
elegant	O
sushi	B-A
	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
better	O
place	O
in	O
New	O
York	O
or	O
anywhere	O
in	O
the	O
US.	O

I	O
am	O
a	O
die	O
hard	O
peep	O
lover.	O

Once	O
you	O
become	O
a	O
regular,	O
you	O
are	O
treated	O
as	O
one.	O

The	O
menu	B-A
	O
seemed	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
wide	O
variety	B-A
of	I-A
dishes	I-A
	O
for	O
seafood	B-A
	O
lovers	O
and	O
interesting	O
ways	O
of	O
preparing	O
them.	O

Everyone	O
treats	O
you	O
like	O
you	O
were	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
family.	O

The	O
white	B-A
bean	I-A
brushetta	I-A
	O
to	O
start	O
was	O
incredible	O
and	O
the	O
pasta	B-A
	O
was	O
phenomenal.	O

The	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
menu	B-A
	O
is	O
limited	O
by	O
everything	O
is	O
good	O
eats	B-A
.	O

The	O
menu	B-A
	O
is	O
nothing	O
like	O
the	O
one	O
on	O
the	O
website.	O

Great	O
food	B-A
,	O
great	O
lay	B-A

Ive	O

	O
and	O
she	O
replied	O
back	O

	O
and	O
just	O
walked	O
away.	O

SEA	O
has	O
become	O
so	O
popular	O
that	O
they've	O
let	O
it	O
go	O
to	O
their	O
heads.	O

We	O
walked	O
in	O
on	O
a	O
Wednesday	O

and	O
were	O
seated	B-A
	O
promptly.	O

Chennai	O
Garden	O
is	O
my	O
favorite	O
Indian	O
restaurant	O
in	O
the	O
city.	O

The	O
wait	B-A
staff	I-A
	O
is	O
very	O
freindly,	O
they	O
make	O
it	O
feel	O
like	O
you're	O
eating	O
in	O
a	O
freindly	O
little	O
european	O
town.	O

Oh	O
yeah	O
ever	O
on	O
the	O
west	O

Arties	O
Cafe.	O

(Besides	O
that	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
more	O
restaurants	O
like	O
it	O
around	O
the	O
city).	O

My	O
roommate	O
and	O
I	O
LOVE	O
this	O
place.	O

The	O
waitstaff	B-A
	O
are	O
all	O
very	O
busy,	O
it's	O
not	O
outstanding	O
service	B-A
,	O
but	O
I've	O
never	O
been	O
dealt	O
with	O
rudely.	O

I	O
have	O
lived	O
in	O
Japan	O
for	O
7	O
years	O
and	O
the	O
taste	B-A
	O
of	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
feel	B-A
	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	O
is	O
like	O
being	O
back	O
in	O
Japan.	O

Not	O
worth	O
it.	O

In	O
the	O
evening,	O
this	O
place	O
attracted	O
a	O
well	O
dressed,	O
with	O
it,	O
NY	O
crowd.	O

They	O
have	O
it	O
all	O
--	O
great	O
price	B-A
,	O
food	B-A
,	O
and	O
service	B-A
.	O

So	O
close,	O
but	O
not	O
good	O
enough.	O

This	O
was	O
on	O
a	O
Tuesday	O
night.	O

Its	O
also	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
a	O
hassle	O
to	O
get	O
to	O
without	O
a	O
car	O
(I	O
happen	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
Inwood).	O

The	O
flavors	B-A
	O
are	O
great,	O
and	O
the	O
menu	B-A
	O
is	O
extensive.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
amazing,	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
so	O
attentive	O
and	O
personable,	O
and	O
how	O
about	O
that	O
ambience	B-A
!	O

This	O
place	B-A
	O
has	O
the	O
best	O
interior	B-A
	O
I	O
have	O
seen	O
anywhere	O
in	O
the	O
northside	O
of	O
W'burg,	O
and	O
will	O
impress	O
whoever	O
you	O
bring	O
there.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
has	O
been	O
consistant	O
for	O
years	O
and	O
it	O
never	O
lets	O
you	O
down.	O

I	O
found	O
the	O
variety	O
of	O
the	O
sashimi	B-A
plate	I-A
	O
to	O
be	O
satisfying	O
-	O
fresh	O
and	O
yummy.	O

And	O
forget	O
what	O
you	O
read	O
under	O
me,	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
isn't	O
that	O
bad	O
either.	O

Don't	O
waste	O
your	O
time,	O
or	O
money!!	O

They	O
don't	O
concern	O
much	O
of	O
customer's	O
health,	O
just	O
want	O
to	O
make	O
money.	O

We	O
couldn't	O
carry	O
our	O
conversation	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
routinely	O
interrupted	O
by	O
waitress	B-A
	O
and	O
servants	B-A
	O
asking	O
us	O
to	O
order	O
and	O
hinting	O
that	O
we're	O
taking	O
too	O
much	O
time	O
--	O
amazing,	O
we	O
just	O
sat	O
down.	O

sometimes	O
i	O
get	O
good	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
ok	O
service	B-A
.	O

We	O
just	O
ate	O
at	O
Kai	O
and	O
were	O
disapointed.	O

It's	O
a	O
place	O
for	O
people	O
who	O
pay	O
a	O
lot	O
for	O
mediocre	O
food	B-A
,	O
noise	B-A
	O
and	O
a	O
chance	O
to	O
be	O
with	O
their	O
fellow	O
bridge	O
and	O
tunnel	O
folks.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
surprise.	O

After	O
complaining	O
about	O
the	O
chicken	B-A
dish	I-A
,	O
the	O
manager	B-A
	O
came	O
over	O
to	O
tell	O
us	O
that,	O
no	O
one	O
had	O
ever	O
complained	O
before,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
just	O
didn't	O
know	O
what	O
the	O
dish	B-A
	O
was	O
supposed	O
to	O
taste	O
like.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
spicy	O
and	O
delicious.	O

I	O
went	O
with	O
my	O
fiance	O
on	O
a	O
Tuesday	O
evening.	O

A	O
little	O
overpriced	O
but	O
worth	O
it	O
once	O
you	O
take	O
a	O
bite.	O

It	O
was	O
wonderful.	O

Went	O
for	O
a	O
late	O
weekday	O
lunch	B-A
.	O

I	O
just	O
don't	O
understand	O
all	O
the	O
hype...	O

Bartender	B-A
	O
was	O
unable	O
to	O
tear	O
himself	O
away	O
from	O
friends	O
at	O
bar	B-A
.	O

Anyways,	O
if	O
you're	O
in	O
the	O
neighborhood	O
to	O
eat	O
good	O
food	B-A
,	O
I	O
wouldn't	O
waste	O
my	O
time	O
trying	O
to	O
find	O
something,	O
rather	O
go	O
across	O
the	O
street	O
to	O
Tamari.	O

Dahkin	O
also	O
offers	O
prix	B-A
fixe	I-A
lunch	I-A
	O
and	O
buffet	B-A
.	O

Although	O
the	O
place	B-A
	O
could	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
eye	O
catching	O
and	O
roomier,	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time,	O
it	O
doesn't	O
really	O
matter.	O

You	O
can	O
barely	O
see	O
who	O
you	O
are	O
with	O
never	O
mind	O
have	O
a	O
conversation.	O

This	O
was	O
my	O
frist	O
time	O
at	O
Cafe	O
St.	O
Bart's	O
and	O
I	O
must	O
say	O
how	O
delicous	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was.	O

I	O
don't	O
get	O
it	O
either.	O

Went	O
on	O
a	O
double	O
date	O
with	O
friend	O
and	O
his	O
girlfriend	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
drinks	B-A
	O
and	O
appetizers	B-A
.	O

Great	O
place	O
to	O
grab	O
a	O
hot	B-A
bagel	I-A
	O
on	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
work.	O

It's	O
like	O
they	O
took	O
leftover	O
chicken	B-A
,	O
poured	O
oil	B-A
	O
and	O
sprinkled	O
pepper	B-A
powder	I-A
	O
over	O
it	O
(the	O
sauce	B-A
	O
was	O
translucent	O
and	O
red).	O

One	O
would	O
think	O
we'd	O
get	O
an	O
apology	O
or	O
complimentary	O
drinks	B-A
	O
-	O
instead,	O
we	O
got	O
a	O
snobby	O
waiter	B-A
	O
wouldn't	O
even	O
take	O
our	O
order	O
for	O
15	O
minutes	O
and	O
gave	O
us	O
lip	O
when	O
we	O
asked	O
him	O
to	O
do	O
so.	O

One	O
of	O
my	O
favorite	O
places	O
in	O
Manhattan.	O

They	O
brought	O
glasses	O
and	O
the	O
bottle,	O
and	O
just	O
left	O
the	O
bottle	O
at	O
our	O
table.	O

We	O
actually	O
gave	O
10%	O
tip	B-A
	O
(which	O
we	O
have	O
never	O
done	O
despite	O
mediocre	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
service	B-A
),	O
because	O
we	O
felt	O
totally	O
ripped	O
off.	O

We	O
were	O
looking	O
forward	O
to	O
nice	O
glass	B-A
of	I-A
Sangria	I-A
	O
when	O
we	O
arrived.	O

I	O
would	O
highly	O
recommand	O
requesting	O
a	O
table	B-A
by	I-A
the	I-A
window	I-A
.	O

While	O
we	O
enjoyed	O
the	O
food	B-A
,	O
we	O
were	O
highly	O
disappointed	O
by	O
the	O
poor	O
service	B-A
	O
(waiter	B-A
	O
was	O
not	O
quite	O
competent	O
and	O
SLOW	O
service	B-A
)	O
and	O
lack	O
of	O
remorse.	O

I	O
for	O
one	O
will	O
never	O
patronize	O
them	O
again.	O

I	O
stumbled	O
upon	O
this	O
great	O
pizzeria	O
as	O
I	O
explored	O
my	O
new	O
neighborhood.	O

After	O
hearing	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
great	O
things	O
about	O
the	O
restaurant,	O
and	O
passing	O
by	O
it	O
on	O
a	O
daily	O
basis,	O
we	O
decided	O
to	O
try.	O

The	O
service	B-A
,	O
however,	O
was	O
a	O
bright	O
flower	O
in	O
a	O
garden.	O

So,	O
again,	O
give	O
it	O
a	O
try.	O

Stay	O
far	O
away	O
from	O
this	O
place.	O

We	O
will	O
come	O
back!!!	O

We've	O
been	O
to	O
Grocery	O
three	O
times	O
and	O
not	O
once	O
has	O
an	O
item	O
on	O
the	O
menu	B-A
	O
disappointed.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
good	O
too	O
but	O
for	O
the	O
most	O
part,	O
it's	O
just	O
regular	O
food	B-A
,	O
nothing	O
special.	O

A	O
touch	O
more	O
jalapeno	B-A
	O
heat	O
for	O
contrast	O
and	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
good	O
indeed.	O

Tried	O
the	O
pad	B-A
see	I-A
ew	I-A
	O
on	O
the	O
recommendation	O
of	O
the	O
last	O
reviewer	O
since	O
it's	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
favorite	O
dishes	B-A
.	O

We'd	O
go	O
back	O
again	O

We	O
ate	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
back	B-A
patio	I-A
,	O
which	O
is	O
worth	O
it	O
as	O
it's	O
cool	O
and	O
the	O
music	B-A
	O
is	O
hear	O
well	O
there.	O

The	O
location	B-A
	O
is	O
perfect.	O

Guacamole+shrimp	B-A
appetizer	I-A
	O
was	O
really	O
great,	O
we	O
both	O
had	O
the	O
filet	B-A
,	O
very	O
good,	O
didn't	O
much	O
like	O
the	O
frites	B-A
	O
that	O
came	O
with,	O
but	O
the	O
filet	B-A
	O
was	O
so	O
good,	O
neither	O
of	O
us	O
cared.	O

The	O
lunch	B-A
special	I-A
	O
is	O
an	O
asbolute	O
steal.	O

This	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
asian-air	O
fusion.	O

Nothing	O
fancy	O
but	O
really	O
good	O
food	B-A
	O
with	O
pretty	O
reasonable	O
price	B-A
.	O

The	B-A
chicken	I-A
pot	I-A
pie	I-A
	O
is	O
excpetiona,	O
the	O
cheeseburger	B-A
	O
huge	O
and	O
delictable,	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
professional	O
wan	O
warm.	O

While	O
I	O
quite	O
liked	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
ambience	B-A
,	O
I'm	O
not	O
quite	O
sure	O
if	O
it	O
they	O
really	O
deserve	O
it	O
the	O
Michelin	O
rating	O
they	O
have	O
displayed	O
so	O
prooudly	O
in	O
the	O
window.	O

i'm	O
surprised	O
about	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
bad	O
reviews	O
posted	O
here	O
-	O
i've	O
been	O
to	O
tamarind	O
about	O
5	O
or	O
6	O
times	O
and	O
always	O
come	O
away	O
extremely	O
satisfied	O
and	O
looking	O
forward	O
to	O
returning.	O

But	O
on	O
a	O
lazy	O
Saturday	O
night,	O
we	O
ended	O
up	O
going.	O

There	O
are	O
a	O
few	O
Italian	O
employees	B-A
	O
who	O
may	O
not	O
speak	O
the	O
best	O
English	O
but	O
for	O

I	O
have	O
never	O

in	O

however,	O
upon	O
reading	O
the	O

Once	O

	O
and	O
once	O
for	O
brunch	B-A
.	O

I've	O
been	O
to	O
at	O
Cafe	O
Spice	O
probably	O
5-8	O
times,	O
it	O
is	O
probably	O
still	O
the	O
best	O
Indian	O
restaurant	O
around	O
Union	O
Square.	O

Not	O
worth	O
the	O
prices	B-A

Would	O

-	O
perfect	O
for	O
those	O
looking	O
for	O
a	O
place	O
close	O
to	O

From	O
the	O
moment	O
you	O
enter	O

the	O
moment	O
you	O
walk	O
out	O
the	O
friendly	O
and	O
helpful	O
staff	B-A
	O
was	O
was	O
just	O
Fantastic.	O

Service	B-A
	O
was	O
good	O
and	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
wonderful.	O

I	O
only	O
have	O
friends.	O

She	O
gets	O
10	O
for	O
her	O
excellent	O
service	B-A
	O
and	O
advice.	O

The	O
restaurant	O
is	O
a	O
bit	O
noisy	O
but	O
that	O
is	O
something	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
overlooked	O
once	O
you	O
sit	O
down	O
and	O
enjoy	O
a	O
great	O
meal	B-A

i	O

with	O
this	O

ago.	O

Please	O
save	O
yourself	O
the	O
frustration.	O

And	O
I	O
say	O
snacking	B-A
	O
because	O
it	O
really	O
is	O
not	O
set	O
up	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
proper	O
dinner	B-A
.	O

The	O
quality	B-A
of	I-A
food	I-A
	O
at	O
this	O
restaurant	O
accompanied	O
	O
by	O
fantastic	O

this	O
place	O
a	O
perfect	O
10!	O

I	O
have	O
eaten	O
at	O
Saul,	O
many	O
times,	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
always	O
consistently,	O
outrageously	O
good.	O

(Always	O
ask	O
the	O
bartender	B-A
	O
for	O
the	O
SEASONAL	B-A
beer	I-A
!!!	O

If	O
your	O
visiting,	O
you'll	O
enjoy	O
the	O
ambiance	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
it's	O
in	O
Time	O
Sq...	O

We	O
were	O
on	O
our	O
way	O
back	O
to	O
NJ,	O
and	O
since	O
I	O
am	O
in	O
NY,	O
we	O
figured	O
why	O
not	O
grab	O
some	O
food	B-A
?	O

sandwiches	B-A
	O
tho	O
pricey	O
are	O
over	O
stuffed	O
-	O
can	O
serve	O
2	O
persons	O
easily	O
thus	O
cost	O
effective!	O

And	O
comparing	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
Chinatown	O
restaurants	O
is	O
simply	O
not	O
fair.	O

Service	B-A
	O
and	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
what	O
any	O
one	O
would	O
expect	O
when	O
spending	O
that	O
type	O
of	O
money.	O

LOVE	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
-	O
felt	O
like	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
Paris.	O

Every	O
course	B-A
	O
was	O
better	O
than	O
the	O
next.	O

Not	O
cheap,	O
but	O
not	O
that	O
expensive	O
either.	O

The	O
staff	B-A
	O
is	O
incredibly	O
helpful	O
and	O
attentive.	O

If	O
presentation	O
and	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
your	O
thing,	O
then	O
this	O
magic	O
show	O
works.	O

Apparently,	O
the	O
good	O
cook	B-A
	O
works	O
then.	O

I	O
was	O
pleasantly	O
suprised.	O

The	O
Yellowtail	B-A
	O
was	O
particularly	O
good	O
as	O
well.	O

One	O
less	O
manhattanite	O
the	O
better.	O

Everyone	O
is	O
welcomed	O
in	O
as	O

The	O
menu	B-A
	O
changed,	O
portions	B-A
	O
were	O
even	O
smaller	O
than	O
before,	O
a	O

a	O

	O
lacked	O

a	O

this.	O

Bill	B-A
	O
a	O

Everyone	O

My	O

only	O
to	O
discover	O
that	O
what	O

not	O
what	O

Worth	O
a	O

A	O

Its	O

On	O
a	O
recent	O
Sunday	O
afternoon,	O
a	O
friend	O
and	O
I	O
accidently	O
found	O
this	O

restaurant	O
on	O
our	O
way	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
pulitzer	O
prize	O
winning	O

DOUBT.	O

The	O
owner	B-A
	O
and	O
staff	B-A
	O
are	O
all	O
Japanese	O
as	O
well	O
and	O
that	O
adds	O
to	O
the	O
entire	O
ambiance	B-A
.	O

Try	O
the	O
congee	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
donut	B-A
like	I-A
deep	I-A
fried	I-A
dough	I-A
they	I-A
call	I-A
Ow	I-A
Ley	I-A
Soh	I-A
,	O
a	O
delicious	O
and	O
sweet	O
tasting	O
bread	B-A
.	O

Although	O
the	O
tables	B-A
	O
may	O
be	O
closely	O
situated,	O
the	O
candle-light	B-A
,	O
food-quality	B-A
	O
and	O
service	B-A
	O
overcompensate.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
delicious	O
and	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
	O
was	O
incredibly	O
helpful	O
and	O
attentive	O
(considering	O
we	O
were	O
the	O
only	O
ones	O
there	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
hour).	O

From	O
the	O
spectacular	O
caviar	B-A
	O
to	O
the	O
hospitable	O
waitstaff	B-A
,	O
I	O
felt	O
like	O
royalty	O
and	O
enjoyed	O
every	O
second	O
of	O
it.	O

I	O
will	O
be	O
going	O
back	O
and	O
heartily	O
recommend	O
it!	O

Would	O
definitely	O
visit	O
again.	O

Definitely	O
worth	O
the	O
trip	O
to	O
Battery	O
Park	O
City!	O

Perhaps	O
this	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
considered	O
extreme	O
to	O
an	O
Upper	O
East	O
Side	O
resident,	O
but	O
for	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
us	O
who've	O
actually	O
eaten	O
ethnic	B-A
food	I-A
,	O
this	O
is	O
simply	O
dull.	O

The	O
place	B-A
	O
was	O
real	O
empty	O
but	O
that	O
was	O
because	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
Sunday	O
they	O
ever	O
opened.	O

This	O
little	O
place	B-A
	O
definitely	O
exceeded	O
my	O
expectations	O
and	O
you	O
sure	O
get	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
food	B-A
	O
for	O
your	O
money	B-A
.	O

Ambience	B-A
	O
is	O
delightful,	O
service	B-A
	O
impeccable.	O

Service	B-A
	O
was	O
excellent,	O
and	O
the	O
AC	B-A
	O
worked	O
very	O
well	O
too	O
(thank	O
God,	O
it	O
was	O
hot!).	O

Tasty	O
but	O
expensive.	O

You	O
get	O
the	O
sense	O
that	O
the	O
people	B-A
	O
there	O
care	O
about	O
their	O
restaurant	O
and	O
about	O
your	O
experience	O
and	O
that	O
is	O
very	O
nice.	O

Both	O
are	O
delicious,	O
the	O
cooks	B-A
	O
are	O
friendly	O
and	O
are	O
willing	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
moment	O
and	O
speak	O
to	O
you	O
and	O
shake	O
your	O
hand.	O

so	O
i	O
thought	O
why	O
not	O
change	O
it	O
up	O
a	O
bit.	O

My	O
friend	O
ordered	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
special	O
sushi	B-A
rolls	I-A
	O
which	O
had	O
excellent	O
presentation	O
and	O
tasted	O
great!	O

Although	O
be	O
warned	O
their	O
dinner	B-A
menu	I-A
to	I-A
sit	I-A
	O
and	O
take	B-A
out	I-A
	O
prices	B-A
	O
are	O
different.	O

The	O
staff	B-A
	O
was	O
accomodating,	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
absolutely	O
delicious	O
and	O
the	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
lovely.	O

P.S.	O
Please	O
don't	O

I	O
wouldn't	O
recommend	O
to	O
my	O
American	O

as	O
it's	O
very	O

They	O
smell	O
like	O
they	O

them	O
with	O

	O

the	O

To	O
celebrate	O
a	O
birthday,	O
three	O
of	O
us	O
went	O
to	O

There	O

and	O
a	O

	O
or	O
glass	B-A
of	I-A

	O
for	O
$8!	O

I	O
really	O
liked	O
the	O
noodle	B-A
dishes	I-A
	O
at	O
Rice	O
Avenue	O
compared	O
to	O
their	O
Green	B-A

.	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
pams	O
with	O
my	O
girlfriend,	O
and	O
i	O
love	O
it.	O

But	O
for	O
whatever	O
reason,	O
prices	B-A
	O
are	O
about	O
twice	O
as	O
high.	O

I	O
am	O
relatively	O
new	O
to	O
the	O
area	O
and	O
tried	O
Pick	O
a	O
bgel	O
on	O
2nd	O
and	O
was	O
disappointed	O
with	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
and	O
I	O
thought	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
overated	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
pricey	O
side.	O

Great	O
atmoshere	B-A
	O
and	O
worth	O
every	O
bit.	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
most	O
unpleasant	O
experience	O
at	O
this	O
restaurant.	O

The	O
spicy	B-A
tuna	I-A
roll	I-A
	O
was	O
unusually	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
rock	B-A
shrimp	I-A
tempura	I-A
	O
was	O
awesome,	O
great	O
appetizer	B-A
	O
to	O
share!	O

The	O
staff	B-A
	O
was	O
knowledgeable	O
and	O
full	O
of	O
personality.	O

Great	O
staff	B-A
.	O

Only	O
complaint	O
would	O
be	O
that	O
at	O
an	O
average	O
cost	B-A
	O
of	O
$12-$15	O
per	O
meal	B-A
,	O
I'd	O
like	O
not	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
worry	O
about	O
finding	O
a	O
seat	B-A
!	O

To	O
finish	O
off	O
such	O
a	O
delightful	O
dinner	B-A
	O
experience	O
you	O
must	O
have	O

the	O

The	O

	O
is	O
an	O
amazing	O
dessert	B-A
	O
as	O
well.	O

I	O
went	O
there	O
with	O
my	O
friend	O
last	O
saturday.	O

Excellent	O

,	O
delicious	O

	O

A	O

	O
to	O

with	O
your	O

for	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O

	O
and	O

Great	O
vibe	B-A
,	O
lots	O
of	O
people.	O

I	O
like	O
Mamoun's	O
food	B-A
	O
as	O
well,	O
but	O
side	O
by	O
side,	O
Kati	O
Rolls	O
just	O
produce	O
tastier	O
food	B-A
	O
hands	O
down.	O

Just	O
an	O
odd	O
group.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
a	O
bit	O
slow,	O
but	O
harkens	O
back	O
to	O
my	O
years	O
growing	O
up	O
in	O
Napoli,	O
Italy	O
where	O
things	O
are	O
not	O
rushed	O
and	O
when	O
you	O
sit	O
down	O
for	O
dinner	B-A
	O
the	O
table	B-A
	O
is	O
yours	O
all	O
night.	O

Either	O
that,	O
or	O
the	O
editor's	O
idea	O
of	O
romance	O
must	O
be	O
sharing	O
a	O
conversation	O
with	O
the	O
next	O
table,	O
while	O
trying	O
to	O
speak	O
louder	O
than	O
the	O
traffic	O
on	O
57th.	O

I	O
love	O
this	O
place!	O

it	O
is	O
not	O
consistent.	O

But	O
that	O
wasn't	O
the	O
icing	B-A
on	I-A
the	I-A
cake	I-A
:	O
a	O
tiramisu	B-A
	O
that	O
resembled	O
nothing	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
had.	O

Great	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
prices	B-A

we	O
did	O
notice	O
however,	O
that	O
some	O

had	O
what	O
looked	O

	O
instead	O
of	O

I	O
didn't	O

the	O

To	O
begin,	O
we	O
were	O
told	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
30	O
minute	O
wait	B-A
	O
and	O
started	O
to	O
leave,	O
when	O
the	O
hostess	B-A
	O
offered	O
to	O
call	O
us	O
on	O
our	O
cell	O
phone	O
when	O
the	O
table	B-A
	O
was	O

The	O

	O
give	O
you	O
some	O
sample	O

you	O
wait	O
(shortly	O
I	O
might	O
add).	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
ok.	O

When	O
asked	O
about	O
how	O
a	O

dish	B-A
	O
was	O
prepared	O
in	O

to	O
a	O
similar	O
at	O

not	O
Mcdonald's,	O
every	O

things	O
differently	O
While	O
it	O
is	O
understandable	O
that	O
every	O

indeed	O

there	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
uncourteous	O
to	O
customers	O
and	O
downright	O
rude.	O

I	O
ate	O
here	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
and	O
absolutely	O
loved	O
it!	O

Don't	O
expect	O
to	O
sit	O
down	O
inside	O
though,	O
there	O
are	O
only	O
a	O
few	O
tables	B-A
	O
and	O
they	O
are	O
always	O
full.	O

The	O
staff	B-A
	O
is	O
accomodating,	O
the	O
ambiance	B-A
	O
is	O
exciting	O
and	O
yet	O

and	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
out	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
delicious	O
(I	O
had	O
a	O
halibut	B-A
special	I-A
,	O
my	O
husband	O
had	O
steak	B-A
),	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
top-notch.	O

The	O
manager	B-A
	O
claimed	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
compensate	O
us	O
for	O
anything	O
on	O
the	O
bill	B-A
	O
which	O
just	O
shows	O
the	O
lack	O
of	O
sophistication	O
from	O
the	O
entire	O

This	O
is	O
by	O
far	O
my	O

But	O
too	O

of	O
the	O
half	B-A

	O
on	O

so	O

we	O
came	O
here	O
on	O
a	O
crowded	O
saturday	O
night	O
and	O
were	O

	O
right	O
away	O
despite	O
being	O
15	O
minutes	O
late	O
for	O
our	O
reservation	B-A
.	O

This	O
place	O
is	O
cool	O
enough	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
the	O
East	O

but	O
French	O
enough	O
to	O
make	O
you	O

you	O
could	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
bistro	O
in	O
a	O

We	O
were	O
fast	O
to	O
order	O
the	O
appetizer	B-A

	O
since	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
hungry.	O

The	O
staff	B-A
	O
are	O
attentive,	O
and	O
have	O
smiles	O
on	O

	O
is	O

here	O
(a	O

but	O
when	O
we	O

at	O

there	O
weren't	O
a	O

most	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
dumplings	B-A
	O
in	O
the	O
appetizer	B-A
	O
section.	O

Maybe	O
I	O
say	O
so	O
because	O
it	O
looked	O
promising	O
for	O
people	O
who	O
like	O
artery-clogging	O
jewish	B-A
deli	I-A

,	O
but	O
turns	O
out	O
to	O
be	O
poorly	O

awful.	O

After	O
my	O
3rd	O
time	O
the	O
manager	B-A
	O
remembered	O
me	O
and	O
treated	O
me	O
like	O

This	O

of	O
different	O
cream	B-A
cheeses	I-A
	O
and	O
all	O
of	O
their	O
salads	B-A
	O
are	O
great.	O

The	O
lobster	B-A
sandwich	I-A
	O
is	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
spaghetti	B-A
with	I-A
Scallops	I-A
and	I-A
Shrimp	I-A
	O
is	O
great.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
authentic.	O

The	O
dim	B-A
sum	I-A
	O
is	O
delectable	O
while	O
the	O
prices	B-A
	O
are	O
quite	O
easy	O
on	O
the	O
wallet.	O

I	O
only	O
tried	O
a	O
simple	O
dish	B-A
	O
of	O
spinach	B-A
ravioli	I-A
in	I-A
a	I-A
light	I-A
oil	I-A
and	I-A
garlic	I-A
sauce	I-A
,	O
but	O
it	O
actually	O
faired	O
better	O
than	O
most	O
NYC	O
Italian	O
joints	O
I've	O
tried	O
similar	O
dishes	B-A
	O
at.	O

The	O
worst	O
excuse	O
for	O
Japanese	B-A
food	I-A
	O
I've	O
ever	O
encountered.	O

A	O
million	O
better	O
places	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
the	O
city.	O

If	O
celebrities	O
make	O
you	O
sweat,	O
then	O
your	O
in	O
for	O
a	O
ride,	O
but	O
if	O
your	O
like	O
most	O
around	O
these	O
parts	O
then	O
you'll	O
just	O
yawn	O
and	O
wonder	O
whats	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
hype.	O

Okay-i	O
don't	O
mind	O
the	O
oily	O
part	O
(cause	O
most	O
are	O
cooked	O
that	O
way)	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
way	O
too	O
bland.	O

I	O
ordered	O
a	O
Chicken	B-A
Teriyaki	I-A
dish	I-A
	O
and	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
chicken	B-A
	O
was	O
extremely	O
dry.	O

I	O
love	O
it.	O

If	O
you	O
want	O
something	O
really	O
different	O
than	O
try	O
Jekyll	O
and	O
Hyde.	O

We	O
had	O
reservations	B-A
	O
at	O
9pm,	O
but	O
was	O
not	O
seated	O
until	O
10:15pm.	O

We	O
had	O
Pam's	B-A
special	I-A
fried	I-A
fish	I-A
	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
amazing.	O

Its	O
located	O
in	O
greenewich	O
village.	O

There	O
is	O
no	O
excuse	O
for	O
such	O
lousy	O
service	B-A
!	O

Three	O
strikes	O
and	O
this	O
restaurant	O
is	O
out.	O

We	O
bring	O
in	O
a	O
party	O
of	O
ten	O
or	O
so	O
every	O
week.	O

My	O
boyfriend	O
had	O
the	O
New	B-A
England	I-A
Chowder	I-A
	O
it	O
was	O
good	O
but	O
I	O
think	O
the	O
award	O
should	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
Lobster	B-A
Bisque	I-A
.	O

So,	O
a	O
little	O
inconsistency	O
there	O
but	O
either	O
way,	O
both	O
pizzas	B-A
	O
were	O
really	O
good.	O

Overall	O
the	O
restaurant	O
is	O
more	O
expensive	O
than	O
our	O
other	O
sushi	B-A
	O
favorites,	O
but	O
everything	O
was	O
delicious.	O

We	O
would	O
return	O
to	O
this	O
place	O
again!	O

Not	O
enough	O
wines	B-A
by	I-A
the	I-A
glass	I-A
	O
either.	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
duck	B-A
breast	I-A
special	I-A
	O
on	O
my	O
last	O
visit	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
incredible.	O

I	O
must	O
say	O
it's	O
a	O
little	O
pricey	O
for	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
as	O
spectacular	O
as	O
the	O
view.	O

These	O
innovators	O
of	O
french	B-A
indian	I-A
fusion	I-A
	O
do	O
a	O
great	O
job	O
of	O
making	O
dishes	B-A
	O
as	O
interesting	O
as	O
possible	O
while	O
still	O
being	O
accessible.	O

Just	O
don't	O
take	O
the	O
seat	B-A
	O
between	O
the	O
bar	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
back	O
half	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant,	O
i	O
saw	O
a	O
woman	O
get	O
nudged	O
40times	O
sitting	O
there.	O

No	O
gimmicks	O
here	O
--	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
speaks	O
for	O
itself	O
in	O
its	O
freshness	O
and	O
preparation.	O

We	O
were	O
worried	O
we	O
would	O
have	O
trouble	O
getting	O
in,	O
but	O
somehow	O
managed	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
short	O
wait	B-A
.	O

My	O
wife	O
had	O
the	O
fried	B-A
shrimp	I-A
	O
which	O
are	O
huge	O
and	O
loved	O
it.	O

Everything	O
I	O
had	O
was	O
good,	O
and	O
I'm	O
a	O
eater.	O

One	O
should	O
not	O
go	O
to	O
Lucky	O
Strike	O
for	O
the	O
food	B-A
.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
awful--the	O
last	O
time	O
I	O
was	O
there	O
(and	O
I	O
do	O
mean	O
the	O
last	O
time)	O
we	O
were	O
told	O
that	O
they	O
needed	O
our	O
table	B-A
	O
so	O
we	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
leave.	O

We	O
could	O
only	O
get	O
through	O
an	O
appetizer	B-A
	O
and	O
cheese	B-A
fondue	I-A
.	O

To	O
me	O
it	O
exemplifies	O
Soho,	O
cute,	O
artsy,	O
interesting.	O

Try	O
everything	O
for	O
that	O
matter,	O
it	O
is	O
all	O
good.	O

Both	O
times	O
we	O
waited	O
well	O
over	O
a	O
half	O
hour	O
for	O
a	O
table	B-A
	O
(even	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
reservations	B-A
).	O

happy	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
regular	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
and	O
would	O
warmly	O
recommend	O
it	O
to	O
anyone.	O

I've	O
been	O
eating	O
at	O
Taj	O
Mahal	O
for	O
over	O
twenty	O
years	O
and	O
have	O
found	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
most	O
excellent	O
of	O
the	O
Indian	O
eateries	O
on	O
this	O
block	O
of	O
Indian	O
restaurants.	O

night	O
without	O
a	O
reservation	B-A
,	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
wait	O
at	O
the	O
bar	B-A
	O
for	O
a	O
little	O
while,	O
but	O
the	O
manager	B-A
	O
was	O
so	O
nice	O
and	O
made	O
our	O
wait	B-A
	O
a	O
great	O
experience.	O

Try	O
the	O
green	B-A
curry	I-A
!!!	O

We	O
had	O
the	O
scallops	B-A
	O
as	O
an	O
appetizer	B-A
	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
delicious	O
and	O
the	O
sauce	B-A
	O
was	O
wonderful.	O

We	O
were	O
also	O
seated	O
promptly	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
our	O
reservation	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
quick	O
and	O
professional.	O

You	O
rarely	O
have	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
a	O
seat	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
currys	B-A
(masaman,	I-A
green,	I-A
red)	I-A
	O
are	O
full	O
of	O
flavor	B-A
	O
and	O
come	O
super	O
spicy	O
if	O
you	O
ask	O
for	O
it.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
there	O
are	O
sastifying.	O

I	O
highly	O
recommend	O
to	O
anyone	O
to	O
give	O
this	O
place	O
a	O
try.	O

I	O
highly	O
recommend	O
visiting	O
this	O
restaurant	O
and	O
having	O
dinner	B-A
	O
and	O
drinks	B-A
!	O

The	O
bar	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
well	O
stocked	O
with	O
interesting	O
beers	B-A
	O
and	O
well	O
priced	B-A
	O
wines	B-A
.	O

I	O
agree.	O

Last	O
memorial	O
day,	O
I	O
tried	O
to	O
make	O
reservations	B-A
	O
but	O
was	O
told	O
they	O
were	O
closed	O
that	O
weekend	O
(interesting,	O
but...).	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
good.	O

Great	O
wine	B-A
selection	I-A
,	O
Gigondas	B-A
	O

the	O

,	O
and	O
the	O
house	B-A
champagne	I-A
	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
value.	O

at	O
night,	O
but	O
it's	O
hard	O
to	O
hear	O
your	O
own	O
conversation	O
with	O
everyone	O
else	O
competing	O
for	O
that	O
same	O
luxury	O
-	O
the	O
music	B-A
	O
playing	O
in	O
the	O
background	O
is	O
also	O
voluminous.	O

It	O
just	O
wasn't	O
Thai.	O

I	O
have	O
enjoyed	O
everything	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
gotten	O
and	O
the	O
fish	B-A
	O
is	O
so	O
fresh	O
and	O
always	O
prepared	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
way.	O

I	O
particularly	O
love	O
their	O
yellowfun	B-A
tuna	I-A
	O
and	O
their	O
mussel	B-A
selection	I-A
.	O

I	O
love	O
to	O
visit	O
Murrays	O
for	O
my	O
bagel	B-A
	O
fix.	O

We	O
made	O
early	O
dinner	B-A
reservations	I-A
	O
and	O
were	O
thoroughly	O
impressed,	O
reminds	O
me	O
of	O
my	O
grandfather,	O
its	O
old	O
school	O
Italian	O
scenery	B-A
	O
with	O
lots	O
of	O
fun	O
stuff	O
to	O
admire.	O

Recommended.	O

The	O
place	B-A
	O
was	O
nice	O
and	O
calm.	O

Cheese	B-A
plate	I-A
	O
is	O
a	O
varied	O
delight	O
and	O
great	O
bargain	O
at	O
$10.	O

I	O
could	O
have	O
drank	O
4	O
glasses	B-A
of	I-A
water	I-A
	O
and	O
still	O
been	O
parched	O
-	O
so	O
watch	O
out.	O

When	O
we	O
sat,	O
we	O
got	O
great	O
and	O
fast	O
service	B-A
.	O

Most	O
of	O
the	O
servers	B-A
	O
are	O
very	O
attentive,	O
friendly	O
and	O
quite	O
attractive.	O

I	O
think	O
locals	O
rate	O
this	O
place	O
so	O
high.	O

Service	B-A
	O
is	O
average.	O

But	O
they've	O
done	O
a	O
really	O
nice	O
job	O
of	O
offering	O
all	O
the	O
typical	O
pizzeria	O
faves	O
plus	O
some	O
terrific	O
specials	B-A
	O
like	O
the	O

Go	O

They	O
forgot	O
a	O
sandwich	B-A
,	O
didn't	O
include	O
plastic	B-A

,	O
and	O
didn't	O
include	O
pita	B-A
	O
with	O
the	O
hummus	B-A
platter	I-A
.	O

The	O
steak	B-A
	O
is	O
good,	O
the	O
fish	B-A
	O
is	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
sushi	B-A
	O
was	O
surprisingly	O
great.	O

For	O
asian	O
fusion,	O
there	O
are	O
many	O
places	O
further	O
downtown.	O

Old	O
school	O
meets	O
New	O

I	O
am	O
reluctant	O
to	O
write	O
because	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
want	O
my	O
jem	O
of	O
a	O
pizza	B-A
	O
place	O
to	O
become	O
overcrowded.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
poor,	O
restaurant	O
poorly	O
lit,	O
staff	B-A
	O
not	O
very	O
attentive	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
rather	O
eaten	O
at	O
a	O
Mcdonald's	O
than	O
this	O
joint.	O

This	O
is	O
probably	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
new	O
favorite	O
places.	O

For	O
being	O
number	O
1,	O
this	O
place	O
has	O
alot	O
of	O
work	O
to	O
do	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
truly	O
earn	O
its	O
so	O
called	O
reputation.	O

For	O
myself	O
and	O
family	O
we	O
would	O
only	O
go	O
here	O
to	O
celebrate	O
an	O
occassion,	O
I	O
do	O
prefer	O
smaller,	O
quiter	O
restaurants.	O

The	O
one	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
is	O
much	O
better	O
than	O
the	O
one	O
on	O
the	O
west	O
side.	O

They	O
all	O
know	O
you.	O

My	O
GF	O
and	O
I	O
still	O
choose	O
to	O
eat	O
there	O
a	O
lot	O
because	O
of	O
diverse	O
cocktails	B-A
,	O
the	O
chill	O
decor	B-A
,	O
and	O
the	O
decent	O
sushi	B-A

We	O
ended	O
the	O

	O
with	O
a	O
surprisingly	O
light	O
and	O
flaky	O
apple	B-A

Waitstaff	B-A
	O
are	O
very	O

This	O
restaurant	O
is	O
such	O
a	O
great	O
place.	O

Once	O
you	O

into	O
Cosette,	O
you're	O
miraculously	O
in	O
a	O

I've	O

	O
expecting	O
to	O
be	O
impressed	O
by	O
a	O
place	O
that	O
has	O
an	O
impressive	O
past	O
-	O
but,	O
that's	O
just	O
it	O
--	O
the	O
PAST!	O

However,	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
a	O
good	O
hang	O
out	O
spot	B-A
.	O

The	O
menu	B-A
	O
is	O
Prix	B-A
Fixe	I-A
,	O
so	O
be	O
prepared	O
to	O
spend	O
at	O
least	O
$60	O
per	O
person,	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
Well	O
worth	O
itsuperb	O
food	B-A
.	O

Rao	O
is	O
a	O
good	O
restaurant,	O
but	O
it's	O
nothing	O
special.	O

The	O
wine	B-A
list	I-A
	O
is	O
extensive	O
and	O
impressive.	O

We	O
had	O
the	O
most	O
wonderful	O
waitress	B-A
.	O

While	O
the	O
staff	B-A
	O
at	O
this	O
little	O
bistro	O
is	O
very	O
friendly,	O
I	O
have	O
never	O
experienced	O
more	O
incompetency.	O

The	O
quail	B-A
	O
was	O
fantastic	O
and	O
unique	O
and	O
the	O
pastas	B-A
	O
were	O
full	O
of	O
flavor	B-A
.	O

When	O
we	O
left	O
at	O
8:00	O
PM,	O
it	O
was	O
packed	O
and	O
noisy.	O

Okay,	O
so	O
I	O
never	O
write	O
but	O
there	O
doesn't	O
seem	O
to	O
fair	O
balance	O
of	O
positive	O
to	O
negative	O
reviews	O
concerning	O
Green	O
Bo	O
and	O
it's	O
time	O
to	O
speak	O
up	O
-	O
I	O
live	O
in	O
Chinatown.	O

The	O
zucchini	B-A
	O
and	O
mashed	B-A
potatoes	I-A
	O
are	O
a	O
blend	O
of	O
garlic	B-A
	O
and	O
butter	B-A
	O
which	O
simply	O
melts	O
in	O
your	O
mouth.	O

The	O
staff	B-A
	O
is	O
courteous	O
and	O
friendly.	O

Never	O
fails	O
to	O
please.	O

Decor	B-A
	O
is	O
nice	O
though	O
service	B-A
	O
can	O
be	O
spotty.	O

Aside	O
from	O
the	O
rushed	O
service	B-A
,	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
impressed	O
with	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
drinks	B-A
.	O

Will	O
absolutely	O
visit	O
again.	O

Make	O
sure	O
you	O
have	O
the	O
Spicy	B-A
Scallop	I-A
roll	I-A
..	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
highly	O
recommend	O
this	O
place	O
to	O
anyone	O
who	O
is	O
looking	O
for	O
a	O
fine	O
Indian	B-A
dining	I-A
experience	I-A
	O
that	O
is	O
definitely	O
a	O
value	O
for	O
your	O
dollar.	O

And	O
even	O
with	O
it's	O
Pub	B-A
atmosphere	I-A
	O
they	O
were	O
great	O
to	O
my	O
kids	O
too!	O

This	O
big	O
draw	O
is	O
the	O
all	O
you	O
can	O
sushi	B-A
	O
here	O
for	O
$19.95!	O

I	O
consider	O
the	O
best	O
Grand	O
Sichuan	O
restaurant	O
in	O
NYC.	O

we	O
spent	O
50	O
$$	O
definetly	O
will	O
come	O
back	O
with	O
my	O
friends!!!	O

Went	O
to	O
Village	O
last	O
night	O
for	O
my	O
birthday.	O

Some	O
of	O
the	O
workers	B-A
	O
ignore	O
me	O
and	O
talk	O
to	O
the	O
female	O
customers,	O
other	O
times,	O
they've	O
skipped	O
my	O
order	B-A
.	O

The	O
specials	B-A
	O
are	O
usually	O
quite	O
good	O
too.	O

They've	O
the	O
best	O
desserts	B-A
	O
and	O
mixed	B-A
drinks	I-A
	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
snack	B-A
foods	I-A

Try	O
the	O
chocolate	B-A
mud	I-A
cake	I-A
(warmed)	I-A
	O
with	O
2	O
scoops	O
of	O
dulce	B-A

.	O

That's	O
good	O
and	O
bad.	O

Really	O
cool	O
stauff	B-A
	O
inside.	O

While	O
the	O
new	O
restaurant	O
still	O
features	O
much	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
classical	B-A
furniture	I-A
	O
that	O
made	O
Tiffin	O
so	O
attractive,	O
the	O
menu	B-A
	O
has	O
been	O
overhauled.	O

The	O
best	O
burger	B-A
	O
I	O
have	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
Village.	O

We	O
visited	O
Orsay	O
during	O
NY	O
Restaurant	O
Week	O
and	O
tried	O
their	O
$35	O
menu	B-A
.	O

I	O
would	O
have	O
gotten	O
some	O
cole	B-A
slaw	I-A
	O
and	O
a	O
knish	B-A
	O
if	O
my	O
stomach	O
had	O
more	O
space.	O

came	O
here	O
for	O
restaurant	O
week,	O
didn't	O
save	O
much,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
still	O
great.	O

Would	O
NEVER	O
go	O
back	O
there.	O

Three	O
of	O
us	O
arrived	O
for	O
dinner	B-A
	O
about	O
5:30	O
on	O
a	O
week	O
night	O
without	O
reservations	B-A
.	O

The	O
blond	B-A
wood	I-A
decor	I-A
	O
is	O
very	O
soothing,	O
the	O
premium	O
sake	B-A
	O
is	O
excellent	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
great.	O

There	O
is	O
usually	O
a	O
wait	B-A
	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
well	O
worth	O
it.	O

Be	O
careful,	O
when	O
they	O
say	O
spicy,	O
they	O
mean	O
it!	O

Your	O
money	B-A
	O
could	O
easily	O
be	O
better	O
spent	O
elsewhere	O
(Anywhere).	O

Only	O
drawback	O
-	O
they	O
won't	O
toast	O
your	O
bagel	B-A
,	O
and	O
they	O
don't	O
make	O
eggs	B-A
	O
for	O
the	O
bagel	B-A
.	O

As	O
always	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
glass	B-A
of	I-A
wine	I-A
	O
while	O
we	O
waited.	O

Bring	O
your	O
appetites.	O

The	O
wait	B-A
staff	I-A
	O
is	O
pleasant,	O
fun,	O
and	O
for	O
the	O
most	O
part	O
gorgeous	O
(in	O
the	O
wonderful	O
aesthetic	O
beautification	O
way,	O
not	O
in	O
that	O
she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$*	O
way).	O

Of	O
course	O
this	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
is	O
lacking,	O
but	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
expect	O
from	O
a	O
24	O
hour	O
bagel	B-A
	O
place	O
anyways?	O

Service	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
and	O
warm.	O

For	O
dinner	B-A
	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
chicken	B-A
tikka-masala	I-A
	O
and	O
some	O
garlic	B-A
naan	I-A
.	O

Cornelia	O
Street	O
looks	O
like	O
a	O
Broadway	O
set	O
for	O
West	O
Side	O
Story	O
and	O
the	O
inside	O
of	O
Po	O
is	O
so	O
cool	O
quaint	O
you	O
really	O
can't	O
top	O
the	O
setting	B-A
	O
for	O
a	O
romantic	O
dinner	B-A
	O
in	O
NYC.	O

Like	O
others	O
have	O
said,	O
don't	O
expect	O
the	O
restaurant	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
nite	O
out	O
romantic	O
for	O
you	O
and	O
yes,	O
a	O
busy	O
restaurant	O
may	O
require	O
you	O
to	O
wait.	O

Seriously,	O
this	O
place	O
kicks	O
ass.	O

Food	B-A
	O
was	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
view	B-A
	O
of	O
the	O
new	O
york	O
city	O
skiline	O
was	O
terrific	O
even	O
on	O
a	O
foggy	O
rainy	O
day	O
like	O
that	O
of	O
when	O
I	O
went.	O

Also,	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
so	O
thin,	O
it	O
gets	O
cold	O
very	O
quickly	O
and	O
its	O
not	O
that	O
filling.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
nothing	O
like	O
its	O
menu	B-A
description	I-A
.	O

Try	O
the	O
Pad	B-A
Se-Ew	I-A
	O
or	O
Chicken	B-A
with	I-A
Cashew	I-A
Nuts	I-A
	O
for	O
a	O
memorable	O
and	O
repeatable	O
experience.	O

It's	O
just	O
O.K.	O
pizza	B-A
.	O

I	O
loved	O
it	O
and	O
would	O
HIGHLY	O
RECOMMEND.	O

I've	O
been	O
here	O
twice	O
now.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
decent	O
at	O
best,	O
and	O
the	O
ambience	B-A
,	O
well,	O
it's	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
opinion,	O
some	O
may	O
consider	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
sweet	O
thing,	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
annoying.	O

THE	O
BEST	O
PLACE	O
TO	O
BRING	O
KIDS	O
OR	O
ANY	O
FRIENDS	O
WHO	O
WANT	O
TO	O
DO	O
SOMETHING	O
DIFFERENT.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
a	O
bit	O
slow,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
friendly.	O

However,	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
understand	O
the	O
extraordinary	O
hype	O
about	O
this	O
restaurant.	O

It's	O
a	O
small	O
cute	O
restaurant.	O

I	O
will	O
be	O
returning.	O

Leon	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
above	O
average	O
for	O
midtown	O
and	O
sligtly	O
better	O
than	O
some	O
of	O

Thius	O

anyone	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
absolutely	O
horrible!	O

Food	B-A
	O
doesn't	O
appear	O
to	O
be	O
cooked	O
on	O
premisis	O
but	O
there's	O
a	O
high	O
turnover	O
so	O
its	O
pretty	O
fresh.	O

Restaurant	O
was	O
dirty	O
and	O
unkempt.	O

Nice	O
place	O
though.	O

Warning:	O
You	O
may	O
find	O
it	O
difficult	O
to	O
dine	O
at	O
other	O
Japanese	O
restaurants	O
after	O
a	O
visit	O
to	O
Mizu!	O

Similar	O
to	O
other	O
Indian	O
restaurants,	O
they	O
use	O
the	O
dinner	B-A
special	I-A
	O
to	O
attract	O
customers	O
at	O
the	O
door.	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
small	O
restuarant	O
so	O
go	O
early	O
and	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
nice	O
and	O
quiet-	O
go	O
late	O
and	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
packed!	O

The	O
people	B-A
with	I-A
carts	I-A
of	I-A
food	I-A
	O
don't	O
understand	O
you	O
because	O
they	O
don't	O
speak	O
English,	O
their	O
job	O
is	O
to	O
give	O
you	O
the	O
delicious	O
food	B-A
	O
you	O
point	O
at.	O

The	O
crackling	B-A
calamari	I-A
salad	I-A
,	O
which	O
is	O
usually	O
a	O
cheap	O
disaster	O
at	O
many	O
restaurants,	O
is	O
crispy	O
and	O
lightly	O
dressed.	O

Not	O
the	O
greatest	O
sushi	B-A
place	I-A
,	O
but	O
excellent	O
for	O
a	O
$19.95	O
all	O
you	O
can	O
eat.	O

Shockingly	O
easy	O
to	O

The	O
Thai	B-A
ice	I-A
tea	I-A
	O
was	O
amazingly	O
smooth	O
and	O
yummy!	O

We've	O
never	O
had	O
any	O
problems	O
with	O
the	O
staff	B-A
	O
but	O
maybe	O
we've	O
been	O
lucky?	O

Drinks	B-A
	O
way	O
over	O
priced	B-A
.	O

The	O
main	O
downside	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
is	O
the	O
nazi-like	O
guy	B-A
	O
running	O
it	O
who	O
constantly	O
complains	O
about	O
the	O
noise	B-A
level	I-A
.	O

What	O
I	O
didn't	O
like	O
was	O
how	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
came	O
right	O
after	O
it	O
was	O
ordered.	O

But	O
WARNING:	O
to	O
all	O
those	O
that	O
use	O
this	O
site	O
be	O
weary,	O
be	O
very	O
weary	O
of	O
recommendations.	O

Moderate	O
prices	B-A
.	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
time	O
at	O
the	O
Jekyll	O
and	O
hyde	O
Pub	O
last	O
night.	O

Try	O
it	O
side	O
by	O
side	O
and	O
there's	O
no	O
comparison.	O

I	O
think	O
I've	O
had	O
some	O
the	O
best	O
meals	B-A
	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
at	O
minnow.	O

My	O
biggest	O
complaint	O
was	O
the	O
un-tasty	O
food	B-A
	O
although	O
presented	O
well.	O

This	O
tiny	O
restaurant	O
is	O
as	O
cozy	O
as	O
it	O
gets,	O
with	O
that	O
certain	O
Parisian	O
flair.	O

So	O
sorry	O
I	O
can't	O
rate	O
this	O
better.	O

Most	O
importantly,	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
excellent.	O

Buon	O
appetito!	O

Great	O
roofdeck	B-A
,	O
nice	O
group	O
of	O
30	O
somethings,	O
but	O
no	O
music	B-A
,	O
kind	O
of	O
quiet.	O

If	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
move	O
from	O
the	O
upper	O
east	O
side,	O
we	O
would	O
genuinely	O
miss	O
this	O
restaurant.	O

The	O
best	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
experience	O
was	O
knowing	O
that	O
the	O
manager	B-A
	O
(a	O
bubbly,	O
friendly	O
young	O
woman	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
smile)	O
truly	O
cared	O
about	O
how	O
we	O
were	O
doing.	O

Ok,	O
for	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
growing	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
Village	O
of	O
NYC,	O
we	O
have	O
spoiled	O
by	O
a	O
plethora	O
of	O
restaurants,	O
most	O
of	O
which	O
stay	O
open	O
very	O
late.	O

However,	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
as	O
plain	O
as	O
sesame	B-A
crusted	I-A
Salmon	I-A
	O
I	O
had.	O

I	O
would	O
highly	O
recommend	O
it.	O

It's	O
great	O
to	O
go	O
for	O
a	O
quick	O
lunch	B-A
	O
either	O
alone	O
or	O
with	O
a	O
friend.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
mediocre	O
at	O
best	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
horrible	O
service	B-A
	O
that	O
made	O
me	O
vow	O
never	O
to	O
go	O
back.	O

LLOOVVE	O
THIS	O
PLACE.	O

So	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
reviews	O
here	O
are	O
accurate	O
about	O
the	O
crowd	B-A
	O
and	O
noise	B-A
.	O

You	O
get	O
what	O
you	O
pay	O
for	O
and	O
with	O
that	O
logic	O
in	O
mind,	O
Spice	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
place	O
to	O
grab	O
some	O
cheap	O
eats	B-A
	O
and	O
drinks	B-A
	O
in	O
a	O
beautiful	O
setting	B-A
.	O

Finally,	O
after	O
all	O
the	O
raving	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
check	O
it	O
out	O
with	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
enthusiastic	O
friends	O
this	O
last	O
Saturday	O
night	O
and	O
let	O
me	O
tell	O
you	O
its	O
all	O
its	O
cracked	O
up	O
to	O
be.	O

Place	O
should	O
also	O
have	O
a	O
1,2,3	O
chili	O
rating	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
authentic...	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
terrible,	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
everything	O
and	O
ask	O
several	O
of	O
different	O

more	O
everytime	O

I	O
go	O
and	O
eat	O
out	O
at	O
many	O
different	O
restaurants	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
one	O
place	O
you	O
have	O
go	O
and	O
try.	O

Other	O
than	O
being	O
a	O
little	O
crowded	O
and	O
a	O
bit	O
overpriced,	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
is	O
filled	O
with	O
energy	O
(and	O
the	O
beautiful	O
people	B-A
	O
of	O
course)	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
surprising	O
good!	O

We	O
only	O
ordered	O
desserts	B-A
	O
and	O
drinks	B-A
,	O
but	O
no	O
refills	O
were	O
offered.	O

Saul	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
restaurant	O
on	O
Smith	O

and	O
in	O
Brooklyn.	O

Waiters	B-A
	O
are	O
slow	O
but	O
sweet.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
here	O
a	O
few	O
times	O
for	O
dinner	B-A
,	O
once	O
for	O

	O
and	O
twice	O
for	O
lunch	B-A
.	O

We	O
went	O
to	O
Ino	O
for	O
Valentines.	O

the	O
real	O
kicker	O
of	O
the	O
menu	B-A
,	O
however,	O
is	O
the	O
beef	B-A
cubes	I-A
	O
or	O
the	O
chicken	B-A
with	I-A
chili	I-A
and	I-A
lemon	I-A
grass	I-A
.	O

It	O
was	O
good,	O
but	O
was	O
not	O
what	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
would	O
be.	O

The	O
music	B-A
	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
among	O
all	O
the	O
Indian	O
restaurants	O
I	O
have	O
visited.	O

The	O
bread	B-A
	O
and	O
lamb	B-A
chops	I-A
	O
I	O
had	O
before	O
the	O
meal	B-A
	O
were	O
quite	O
good,	O
however.	O

He	O
always	O
says,	O
I	O
don't	O
have	O
customers.	O

Rao's	O
has	O
the	O
best	O
service	B-A
	O
and	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
in	O
NYC.	O

instead	O
ordered	O
an	O
ice	O
cold	O
beer	B-A
	O
which	O
to	O
me	O
works	O
with	O
indian.	O

Good	O
for	O
dates	O
or	O
with	O
friends.	O

They	O
never	O
brought	O
us	O
complimentary	O
noodles	B-A
,	O
ignored	O
repeated	O
requests	O
for	O
sugar	B-A
,	O
and	O
threw	O
our	O
dishes	B-A
	O
on	O
the	O
table.	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
Chicken	B-A
Tikka	I-A
Masala	I-A
.	O

Excellent	O
dumplings	B-A
	O
served	O
amid	O
clean,	O
chic	O
decor	B-A
.	O

The	O
kitchen	B-A
	O
however,	O
is	O
almost	O
always	O
slow.	O

The	O
corned	B-A
beef	I-A
	O
and	O
pastrami	B-A
	O
are	O
excellent,	O
much	O
less	O
fatty	O
than	O
those	O
big	O
tourist	O
places	O
around	O
Times	O
Square.	O

Cute	O
place	B-A
,	O
nice	O
wait	B-A
staff	I-A
	O
but	O
would	O
never	O
go	O
there	O
again.	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
good	O
time.	O

Also,	O
the	O
hostess	B-A
	O
called	O
me	O
today	O
to	O
thank	O
us	O
for	O
coming	O
and	O
mentioned	O
how	O
she	O
hoped	O
that	O
my	O
girlfriend	O
enjoyed	O
her	O
birthday	O
-	O
unexpected,	O
but	O
a	O
truly	O
above	O
and	O
beyond	O
thing	O
to	O
do...	O

people	B-A
	O
are	O
rude	O
bit	O
again	O
it's	O
new	O
york!	O

We	O
all	O
felt	O
it	O
was	O
worth	O
it.	O

The	O
plain	B-A
slice	I-A
	O
is	O
great	O
and	O
if	O
you	O
get	O
toppings	B-A
,	O
the	O
whole	O
slice	O
is	O
topped	O
with	O
them,	O
not	O
sparsely	O
sprinkled	O
on	O
like	O
some	O
places.	O

Service	B-A
	O
was	O
also	O
horrible	O
and	O
the	O
ambience	B-A
	O
is	O
not	O
that	O
great.	O

Service	B-A
	O
is	O
great,	O
takeout	B-A
	O
is	O
good	O
too.	O

Based	O
on	O
the	O
reviews	O
on	O
here,	O
it	O
appears	O
that	O
the	O
restaurant	O
is	O
overwhelmed	O
after	O
the	O
7	O
PM.	O

The	O
pizza	B-A
	O
is	O
overpriced	O
and	O
soggy.	O

Everything	O
is	O
excellent,	O
the	O
menu	B-A
	O
is	O
quite	O
extensive,	O
and	O
you	O
eat	O
with	O
a	O
view	B-A
	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
of	O
the	O
city.	O

You'll	O
pay	O
at	O
least	O
double	O
at	O
any	O
other	O
Italian	O
restaurant	O
in	O
the	O
city,	O
and	O
most	O
still	O
don't	O
compare.	O

For	O
the	O
quality	B-A
of	I-A
food	I-A
,	O
a	O
little	O
too	O
expensive.	O

Came	O
looking	O
for	O
this	O
place	O
because	O
I	O
heard	O
good	O
things.	O

I	O
live	O
on	O
the	O
street	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
on.	O

Horrible.	O

Here's	O
to	O
the	O
fake	O
fish	B-A
tanks	I-A
	O
too...	O

Its	O
worth	O
the	O
wait	B-A
	O
though.	O

I've	O
never	O
had	O
bad	O
service	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
fish	B-A
	O
is	O
fresh	O
and	O
delicious.	O

The	O
first	O
time	O
I	O
went,	O
and	O
was	O
completely	O
taken	O
by	O
the	O
live	B-A
jazz	I-A
band	I-A
	O
and	O
atmosphere	B-A
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
Lobster	B-A
Cobb	I-A
Salad	I-A
.	O

we	O
decided	O
to	O
eat	O
in	O
tea	B-A
room	I-A
	O
which	O
was	O
small	O
and	O
cute.	O

What	O
an	O
amazing	O
meal	B-A
	O
and	O
experience!	O

Unique	O
apppetizers	B-A
.	O

The	O
staff	B-A
	O
has	O
always	O
been	O
attentive	O
and	O
kind,	O
and	O
I've	O
always	O
been	O
amazed	O
at	O
how	O
they've	O
handled	O
all	O
the	O
various	O
different	O
group	O
sizes	O
that	O
come	O
in.	O

IT	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
deal	O
in	O
town	O
for	O
a	O
Monday	O
night	O
dinner	B-A
	O
at	O
a	O
fine	O
restaurant.	O

Nothing	O
special	O
about	O
this	O
place.	O

Also,	O
the	O
sandwiches	B-A
	O
(nearing	O
$7)	O
didn't	O
come	O
with	O
anything	O
like	O
chips	B-A
	O
or	O
a	O
side	B-A
.	O

and	O
never	O
strayed.	O

The	O
wait	B-A
	O
here	O
is	O
long	O
for	O
dim	B-A
sum	I-A
,	O
but	O
if	O
you	O
don't	O
like	O
sharing	O
tables	B-A
	O
or	O
if	O
the	O
typical	O
raucous	O
dim	B-A
sum	I-A
atmosphere	I-A
	O
is	O
not	O
your	O
gig,	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
sleek	O
(for	O
Chinatown)	O
alternative.	O

Leave	O
the	O
kids	O
at	O
home!	O

This	O
place	O
has	O
good	O
potential,	O
but	O
needs	O
a	O
significant	O
amount	O
of	O
work	O
before	O
we	O
can	O
justify	O
spending	O
that	O
much	O
money	B-A
	O
on	O
indian	B-A
food	I-A
	O
you	O
can	O
get	O
everywhere	O
else.	O

Everything	O
is	O
always	O
cooked	O
to	O
perfection,	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
excellent,	O
the	O

	O
cool	O
and	O
understated.	O

And	O
all	O
of	O
that	O
won't	O
break	O
your	O
bank!	O

The	O
Thai	B-A
food	I-A
	O
is	O

Just	O

As	O
I	O
made	O
the	O
title,	O
it's	O
an	O
affordable	O
restaurant	O
for	O
great	O

.	O

They	O
even	O
scoop	O
it	O
out	O
nice	O
(for	O
those	O
on	O
a	O
diet)	O
not	O
too	O

!	O

Orsay,	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
pleasnt	O
throw	O

to	O
traditional	O
French	B-A

and	O

It's	O

to	O
get	O
a	O

a	O
large	O

you	O
don't	O

Great	O

	O
at	O
reasonable	O

Salads	B-A

way	O
to	O
begin	O
the	O

I	O
ordered	O
tamarind	B-A

	O
evoked	O
Thai	B-A
flavors	I-A
	O
in	O

ways.	O

That's	O
why	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
pay	O

for	O
that.	O

They're	O

	O
a	O

The	O
tuna	B-A

The	O
only	O
disappointment	O
was	O
the	O

	O
who	O
didn't	O

My	O

me	O
to	O
Scopa	O
last	O
week	O
for	O
my	O

and	O
I	O
couldn't	O
believe	O
the	O

Ummm...the	O

	O
was	O
cold.	O

I	O
take	O
all	O
my	O
NYC	O
guests	O
to	O
VT's.	O

It	O
is	O
sometimes	O
a	O
little	O
cramped,	O
and	O
can	O
get	O
a	O
little	O
warm,	O
but	O
hello,	O
it's	O
NYC!	O

We	O
had	O
great	O
desserts	B-A
	O
(including	O
the	O
best	O
cannoli	B-A
	O
I've	O
ever	O
had)	O
and	O
then	O
they	O
offered	O
an	O
after	B-A
dinner	I-A
drink	I-A
,	O
on	O
the	O
house.	O

Good	O
crowd,	O
good	O
outdoor	B-A
seating	I-A
,	O
with	O
a	O
hip	O
japanese	O
vibe	B-A
.	O

Even	O
with	O
the	O
prix	B-A
fixe	I-A
pricing	I-A
,	O
this	O
restaurant	O
is	O
not	O
worth	O
it.	O

We	O
asked	O
to	O
be	O
moved	O
(which	O
took	O
half	O
an	O
hour),	O
and	O
then	O
were	O
seated	O
in	O
a	O
high	O
traffic	O
area	B-A
	O
in	O
the	O
back,	O
even	O
though	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
room	B-A
	O
was	O
practically	O
empty.	O

Good	O
to	O
find	O
a	O
restaurant	O
where	O
the	O
owners	B-A
	O
have	O
some	O
imagination	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
actually	O
pulled	O
it	O
off,	O
like	O
in	O
this	O
case.	O

However,	O
their	O
popularity	O
has	O
yet	O
to	O
slow	O
down,	O
and	O
I	O
still	O
find	O
myself	O
drawn	O
to	O
their	O
ambiance	B-A
	O
and	O
delectable	O
reputation.	O

Where	O
tanks	B-A
	O
in	O
other	O
Chinatown	O
restaurants	O
display	O
a	O
lurking	O
myriad	O
of	O
sad-looking	O
marine	O
life	O
in	O
their	O
murky	O
waters,	O
the	O
tanks	B-A
	O
at	O
Ping's	O
are	O
clear	O
as	O

with	O
healthy-looking	O
creatures	O
who	O
do	O
not	O
yet	O
know	O
that	O
they	O
will	O
be	O

brunch	B-A
.	O

The	O
Halibut	B-A
	O
was	O
too	O
salty,	O
dessert	B-A
	O
was	O
so	O
so	O
(don't	O
waste	O
any	O
of	O
your	O
calories)	O
and	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
poor.	O

The	O
view	B-A
	O
is	O
spectacular,	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
great.	O

The	O
place	B-A
	O
wasn't	O
too	O
hard	O
to	O
find,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
packed,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
and	O
I	O
got	O
our	O
food	B-A
,	O
the	O
line	O
reached	O
the	O
door.	O

Good	O
bagels	B-A
	O
and	O
good	O
cream	B-A
cheese	I-A
.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
wonderful,	O
tasty	O
and	O
filling,	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
professional	O
and	O
friendly.	O

It	O
is	O
also	O
extremely	O
well	O
priced	B-A
.	O

Always	O
great	O
service	B-A
!	O

I	O
am	O
happy	O
i	O
did	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
awsome.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
in	O
many	O
restaurants	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
city	O
and	O
Roth's	O
Steakhouse	O
has	O
quickly	O
become	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
favorites.	O

We	O
ordered	O
the	O
chicken	B-A
casserole	I-A
,	O
but	O
what	O
we	O
got	O
were	O
a	O
few	O
small	O
pieces	O
of	O
chicken	B-A
,	O
all	O
dark	O
meat	B-A
	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
bone.	O

A	O
bit	O
breezy	O
up	O
there	O
on	O
the	O
mezzanine	B-A
	O
from	O
the	O
wind	O
coming	O
from	O
the	O
tracks.	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
DF	O
for	O
Valentines	B-A
Day	I-A
dinner	I-A
.	O

I	O
recommend	O
the	O
jelly	B-A
fish	I-A
,	O
drunken	B-A
chicken	I-A
	O
and	O
the	O
soupy	B-A
dumplings	I-A
,	O
certainly	O
the	O
stir	B-A
fry	I-A
blue	I-A
crab	I-A
.	O

I	O
LOVED	O
THE	O
SHOWS	B-A
.	O

and	O
i	O
have	O
been	O
around	O
the	O
block,	O
to	O
say	O
the	O
very	O
least.	O

We	O
could	O
have	O
made	O
a	O
meal	B-A
	O
of	O
the	O
yummy	O
dumplings	B-A
	O
from	O
the	O
dumpling	B-A
menu	I-A
.	O

The	O
aesthetics	B-A
	O
of	O
this	O
place	B-A
	O
are	O
like	O
an	O
airport	O
lounge.	O

Then,	O
get	O
ripped	O
on	O
free	O
box	B-A
wine	I-A
.	O

My	O
wife	O
and	O
I	O
ate	O
here	O
earlier	O
this	O
week	O
and	O
have	O
not	O
stopped	O
ranting	O
and	O
raving	O
about	O
the	O
food	B-A
.	O

If	O
you	O
don't	O
mind	O
pre-sliced	O
low	O
quality	O
fish	B-A
,	O
unfriendly	O
staff	B-A
	O
and	O
a	O
sushi	B-A
chef	I-A
	O
that	O
looks	O
like	O
he	O
is	O
miserable	O
then	O
this	O
is	O
your	O
place.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
itself	O
was	O
just	O
ok	O
-	O
nothing	O
spectacular	O
-	O
but	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
awful.	O

The	O
pizza	B-A
	O
is	O
yummy	O
and	O
I	O
like	O
the	O
atmoshpere	B-A
.	O

As	O
there	O
were	O
so	O
many	O
to	O
choose	O
from	O
we	O
wandered	O
up	O
and	O
down	O
the	O
street	O
looking	O
in	O
the	O
windows	O
and	O
such	O
noticicing	O
many	O
empty	O
seats	B-A
	O
,except	O
at	O
Taj	O
Mahal.	O

Also,	O
don't	O
plan	O
on	O
asking	O
for	O
your	O
favorite	O
roll	B-A
,	O
if	O
it's	O
not	O
on	O
the	O
menu	B-A
,	O
you	O
can't	O
have	O
it.	O

Give	O
it	O
a	O
try	O
and	O
enjoy.	O

Good	O
food	B-A
.	O

...and	O
that's	O
saying	O
a	O
lot.	O

those	O
rolls	B-A
	O
were	O
big,	O
but	O
not	O
good	O
and	O
sashimi	B-A
	O
wasn't	O
fresh.	O

The	O
pesto	B-A
pizza	I-A
	O
was	O
excellent,	O
thin-crust	B-A
pizza	I-A
	O
with	O
a	O
nice	O
amount	O
of	O
spicy	O
Italian	B-A
cheese	I-A
	O
that	O
I'd	O
never	O
heard	O
of	O
before.	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
I	O
could	O
get	O
attention	O
from	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
at	O
least	O
two	O
cats	O
running	O
around	O
that	O
kept	O
batting	O
at	O
my	O
table.	O

if	O
your	O
into	O
thai..you	O
cannot	O
miss	O
this	O
great	O
restaurant.	O

Going	O
to	O
Ballato's	O
is	O
like	O
coming	O
home	O
and	O
eating	O
in	O
my	O
own	O
kitchen,	O
an	O
absolute	O
delight!	O

try	O
the	O
spicy	O
shrimp	B-A
appetizer	I-A
	O
(again,	O
not	O
the	O
greatest	O
value	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
but	O
worth	O
the	O
price	B-A
)	O
and	O
the	O
lamb	B-A
vindaloo	I-A
	O
is	O
great.	O

However,	O
go	O
for	O
the	O
ambience	B-A
,	O
and	O
consider	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
just	O
a	O
companion	O
for	O
a	O
trip	O
across	O
the	O
world!	O

I	O
think	O
this	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
more	O
underrated	O
places	O
in	O
the	O
city.	O

for	O
out-of-towners	O
who	O
will	O
get	O
a	O
big	O
thrill	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
location!	O

Everyone	O
that	O
has	O
ever	O
come	O
here	O
with	O
me	O
has	O
become	O
a	O
convert	O
and	O
returned	O
regularly	O
with	O
their	O
own	O
friends.	O

Food	B-A
	O
was	O
good	O
not	O
great	O
not	O
worth	O
the	O
wait	B-A
	O
or	O
another	O
visit	O

I	O
go	O
at	O
least	O
3	O
times	O
a	O
month	O
and	O
have	O
never	O
been	O
disappointed.	O

Obviously	O
the	O
Chinese	O
translation	O
of	O
this	O
place	O
does	O
not	O
mean	O
Big	O
Wong,	O
it	O
actually	O
means	O
Great	O
Prosperity.	O

I	O
think	O
the	O
restaurant	O
was	O
too	O
loud	O
(when	O
full)	O
to	O
be	O
romantic.	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
so	O
many	O
dinners	B-A
	O
here	O
and	O
it's	O
always	O
been	O
perfect	O
-	O
on	O
a	O
date	O
with	O
my	O
husband,	O
with	O
my	O
mom,	O
with	O
girlfriends	O
and	O
larger	O
groups.	O

When	O
you	O
want	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
beef	B-A
,	O
head	O
on	O
over.	O

Delicate	O
spices	B-A
,	O
onions	B-A
,	O
eggs	B-A
	O
and	O
a	O
kick-ass	O
roti	B-A
.	O

Incredible	O
food	B-A
	O
at	O
a	O
very	O
agreable	O
price	B-A
	O
brings	O
me	O
back	O
just	O
about	O
every	O
other	O
day	O
to	O
this	O
authentic	O
Thai	O
restaurant.	O

I	O
actually	O
gave	O
Patroon	O
another	O
chance	O
before	O
writing	O
this,	O
but	O
the	O
second	O
visit	O
was	O
even	O
worse.	O

Also,	O
if	O
you	O
don't	O
want	O
to	O
sit	O
at	O
a	O
certain	O
table	B-A
,	O
you	O
don't	O
have	O
to!	O

Unbelievable.	O

A	O
little	O
pricey	O
but	O
it	O
really	O
hits	O
the	O
spot	O
on	O
a	O
Sunday	O
morning!	O

I've	O
been	O
living	O
in	O
the	O
Columbia	O
University	O
area	O
for	O
about	O
10	O
years	O
with	O
3	O
kids	O
-	O
now	O
in	O
their	O
teens.	O

The	O
menu	B-A
	O
has	O
lots	O
of	O
options:	O
I	O
hope	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
try	O
those	O
potato	B-A
pancakes	I-A
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
wake	O
up	O
on	O
a	O
saturday	O
or	O
sunday	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
on	O
my	O
mind	O
is	O
when	O
and	O
how	O
I	O
will	O
be	O
getting	O
to	O
fried	B-A
dumpling	I-A
.	O

The	O
staff	B-A
	O
isn't	O
the	O
friendliest	O
or	O
most	O
competent,	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
stickler	O
for	O
service	B-A
,	O
but	O
everything	O
else	O
about	O
this	O
place	O
makes	O
up	O
for	O
it.	O

My	O
wife	O
and	O
I	O
will	O
usually	O
only	O
order	O
one	O
primi	B-A
	O
and	O
one	O
secondi	B-A
	O
and	O
split	O
them,	O
as	O
they	O
tend	O
to	O
offer	O
large	O
portions	B-A
.	O

This	O
restaurant	O
was	O
way	O
overhyped.	O

I've	O
overheard	O
comments	O
from	O
him	O
to	O
his	O
employees	B-A
	O
that	O
should	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
delivered	O
in	O
the	O
dining	B-A
area	I-A
	O
and	O
I've	O
been	O
sitting	O
there	O
while	O
he	O
lectured	O
another	O
customer.	O

Delicious	O
crab	B-A
cakes	I-A
	O
too.	O

Now	O
at	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
our	O
list,	O
Del	O
Frisco's	O
Steakhouse.	O

I	O
cannot	O
imagine	O
you	O
not	O
rushing	O
out	O
to	O
eat	O
there.	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
worst	O
dining	B-A
experience	I-A
	O
I've	O
ever	O
had.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
coming	O
here	O
for	O
years	O
and	O
have	O
nothing	O
but	O
good	O
things	O
to	O
say	O
about	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
great	O
staff	B-A
	O
at	O
La	O
Lanterna.	O

Just	O
bring	O
someone	O
who	O
speaks	O
Cantonese	O
because	O
waiter	B-A
	O
may	O
not	O
understand	O
you.	O

I	O
thought	O
I	O
had	O
died	O
and	O
gone	O
to	O
heaven.	O

Not	O
someplace	O
I	O
would	O
seek	O
to	O
try	O
out	O
but	O
if	O
I	O
am	O
in	O
the	O
area	O
again,	O
I	O
will	O
certainly	O
stop	O
by.	O

The	O
bruschetta	B-A
	O
and	O
panini	B-A
's	O
are	O
so	O
yummy!	O

Food	B-A
	O
was	O
okay,	O
nothing	O
great.	O

Every	O
waitress	B-A
	O
and	O
customer	O
who	O
passed	O
by	O
me	O
bumped	O
into	O
my	O
chair.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
going	O
there	O
since	O
it	O
opened	O
and	O
I	O
can't	O
get	O
enough.	O

Always	O
popular,	O
always	O
full,	O
always	O
a	O
wait	B-A
.	O

In	O
fact,	O
you	O
can't	O
miss	O
it.	O

I	O
recently	O
tried	O
Suan	O
and	O
I	O
thought	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
great.	O

A	O
little	O
noise	O
but	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
was	O
because	O
of	O
our	O
party!	O

It	O
is	O
run	O
by	O
the	O
same	O
Sichuan	B-A
chef	I-A
	O
who	O
started	O
the	O
chain	O
in	O
Chinatown.	O

Get	O

settled	O
into	O
a	O
groove	O

If	O
the	O

a	O

tuna	I-A
roll	I-A
	O
wrapped	O
with	O
not-so-fresh	O
nori	B-A
	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
rather	O
limp	O
performance.	O

I	O
can't	O
wait	O
for	O
summer,	O
when	O
they	O
serve	O

I'd	O
definitely	O
recommend	O
this	O
little	O
place.	O

Again,	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
in	O
this	O
neighborhood	O
-	O
by	O
all	O
means,	O
come	O
here.	O

The	O
first	O
2	O
courses	B-A
	O
were	O
very	O
good,	O
but	O
the	O
chocolate	B-A
sampler	I-A
	O
was	O
too	O
rich	O
for	O
me	O
and	O
the	O
dessert	B-A
wine	I-A
	O
far	O
too	O
sweet.	O

Butter	B-A
	O
was	O
melted,	O
white	B-A
wine	I-A
	O
warm,	O
cheese	B-A
	O
oozing	O
everywhere.	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
party	O
in	O
their	O
private	B-A
room	I-A
	O
and	O
they	O
made	O
it	O
truly	O
memorable	O
and	O
were	O
very	O
helpful	O
in	O
the	O
planning.	O

Do	O
yourself	O
a	O
favor	O
and	O
walk	O
the	O
extra	O
avenue	O
from	O
joe's	O
to	O
eat	O
here.	O

It	O
cannot	O
be	O
the	O
ambience	B-A
,	O
because	O
the	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
cramped	O
and	O
some	O
guests	O
have	O
to	O
sit	O
in	O
an	O
aisle	B-A
.	O

I	O
have	O
eaten	O
at	O
Shabu	O
Tatsu	O
at	O
least	O
5	O
times	O
and	O
I	O
always	O
want	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
for	O
more!	O

We	O
were	O
disappointed	O
with	O
the	O
pre-fixe	B-A
menu	I-A
	O
of	O
only	O
2	O
choices	B-A
per	I-A
course	I-A
	O
(other	O
restaurants	O

ended	O
up	O

The	O
staff	B-A
	O
has	O
always	O
been	O
friendly	O
without	O
seeming	O
grating,	O
and	O
the	O
chef	B-A
	O
has	O
greeted	O
us	O
on	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
occasions.	O

Get	O
it	O
together.	O

The	O
eggplant	B-A
parmesan	I-A
	O
is	O
also	O
great,	O
and	O
my	O
friend	O
who	O
grew	O
up	O
in	O
Manhattan	O
claims	O
that	O
no	O
one	O

Service	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
-	O
prompt,	O
attentive	O
and	O
non-intrusive.	O

My	O
entree	B-A
	O
of	O
hot	B-A
pot	I-A
with	I-A
seafood	I-A
	O
was	O
full	O
of	O

	O
with	O
a	O
couple	O
pieces	O
of	O
shrimp	B-A
	O
and	O
squid	B-A
,	O
and	O
was	O
unnecessarily	O
heated	O
with	O

We	O
began	O
with	O
the	O
cheese	B-A
fondue	I-A
	O
(the	O

and	O
added	O

In	O
such	O
a	O

to	O
find	O
a	O
good	O
value	B-A
	O
for	O

this	O

Its	O
not	O

in	O
a	O

of	O
the	O

In	O
fact,	O
while	O
leaving	O
the	O
place	O
we	O
saw	O
two	O
people	O
looking	O
at	O
the	O
menu	B-A
,	O
and	O
I	O
couldn't	O
help	O
telling	O
them	O
that	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
horrible.	O

Even	O
though	O
the	O
restaurant	O
was	O
packed,	O
we	O
were	O
seated	B-A
	O
promptly	O
and	O
even	O
asked	O
for	O
a	O
table	B-A
	O
upstairs	O
with	O
no	O

The	O

	O
is	O
the	O
soft	O
paratha	B-A
bread	I-A
	O
(unlike	O
the	O
plain	O
bread	B-A
	O
they	O
use	O
in	O
Calcutta),	O
and	O
the	O
stuffing	B-A
	O
is	O
tandoori	B-A
	O
styled	O
and	O
very	O
flavorful.	O

Service	B-A
	O
is	O
friendly,	O
prices	B-A
	O
are	O
good	O
-	O
delivery	B-A
time	I-A

but	O
for	O
the	O
way	O
this	O
pizza	B-A
	O
tastes,	O
I'm	O
willing	O
to	O
overlook	O
it.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
can	O
get	O
pricey	O
but	O
the	O
prixe	O
fixe	O
tasting	O
menu	O
is	O
the	O
greatest	O
food	B-A
	O
for	O
a	O
good	O

	O
and	O
they	O

the	O

	O
is	O

and	O
the	O

An	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
however,	O
is	O
what	O

might	O
expect.	O

I	O
LOVE	O
their	O

it	O
Yon	O

Yon	O

The	O
pizza	B-A
	O
was	O
really	O
good.	O

The	O
only	O
possible	O
drawback	O
to	O
this	O
last	O
point	O
is	O
that	O
as	O
of	O
the	O
date	O
of	O
this	O
posting,	O
the	O
additional	O
menu	B-A
items	I-A
	O
are	O
only	O
written	O
in	O
Chinese.	O

Food	B-A
	O
is	O
average,	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
say	O
even	O
the	O
chain	O
restaurant	O
Baluchi's	O
tastes	O
better.	O

The	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
small	O
and	O
cramped	O
but	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
fantastic.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
tasty	O
and	O
portion	B-A
sizes	I-A
	O
are	O
appropriate.	O

A	O
little	O
crowded	O
but	O
they	O
move	O
that	O
line	O
really	O
fast!	O

Enjoy!!!	O

Kosher	B-A
dills	I-A
	O
are	O
the	O
perfect	O
compliment	O
for	O
your	O
unforgetable	O
sandwich	B-A
	O
and	O
they	O
give	O
you	O
plenty	O
of	O
them.	O

Kudos	O
to	O
Po!	O

The	O
entertainment	B-A
	O
was	O
great	O
they	O
have	O

that	O
go	O
on	O
through	O
out	O

My	O
boyfriend	O

I	O
were	O
in	O
NY	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
and	O
Pastis	O
was	O
a	O
place	O
that	O
came	O
recommended.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
so	O
cheap	O
and	O
the	O
waiters	B-A
	O
are	O
nice.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
there	O
is	O
so	O
good	O
that	O
even	O
to	O
order	O
out	O
the	O
wait	B-A
	O
is	O
incredible.	O

The	O
bartender	B-A
	O
on	O
my	O
most	O
recent	O
visit	O
was	O
so	O
incredibly	O
rude	O
that	O
I	O
will	O
never	O
go	O
back.	O

Their	O
sushi	B-A
,	O
Kamikaze	B-A
	O
and	O
other	O
Rolls	B-A
	O
are	O
fresh	O
and	O
well	O
presented.	O

For	O
authentic	O
Thai	B-A
food	I-A
,	O
look	O
no	O
further	O
than	O
Toons.	O

It's	O
true,	O
you	O
feel	O
like	O
your	O
in	O
a	O

from	O
Goodfellas.	O

I	O
read	O
the	O

and	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
opposite	O
experience	O
here	O
last	O
Sunday.	O

The	O
highlight	O
of	O
the	O
night	O
was	O
the	O
mayonaisse	B-A
	O
for	O
my	O
side	O
of	O

	O
I	O
received	O
from	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
food	B-A
runners	I-A
,	O
which	O
is	O
not	O
good	O
considering	O
the	O
bill	B-A
	O
was	O
nearly	O
$100.	O

I	O
choose	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
special	B-A
,	O
the	O
braised	B-A
lamb	I-A

which	O
was	O

Never	O
again!	O

The	O
only	O
concern	O

is	O
with	O
the	O
slighly	O
all-business	O
waitstaff	B-A
	O
who	O
order	O
and	O
throw	O
the	O

it	O
was	O
good.	O

So	O
rude.	O

you	O
can	O
actually	O
get	O
2	O

	O
worth	O
if	O
u	O
take	O
it	O
home	O
and	O
add	O
it	O
to	O
some	O
lettuce	B-A
!	O

The	O
ambience	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
romantic	O
and	O
definitely	O
a	O
good	O
place	B-A
	O
to	O
bring	O
a	O
date.	O

They	O
are	O
FAST.	O

It	O
is	O
far	O
more	O
popular	O
as	O
a	O
bar	B-A
	O
than	O
as	O
a	O
restaurant,	O
with	O
only	O
a	O
few	O
tables	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
	O
being	O
the	O
bartender	B-A
,	O
but	O
we	O
greatly	O
enjoyed	O
the	O
unobtrusive	O
atmosphere	B-A
.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
good	O
for	O
it's	O
price	B-A
,	O
better	O
than	O
most	O
fried	B-A
dumplings	I-A
	O
I've	O
had.	O

There	O
are	O
much	O
better	O
places	O
in	O
NY	O
with	O
better	O
prices	B-A

Very	O
neighborhoody,	O
very	O
quick	O

Obv	B-A
caviar	I-A

top	O
of	O
the	O
line	O
but	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
menu	B-A
	O
is	O
so	O
diverse	O
it	O
gives	O
you	O
a	O
chance	O
to	O

so	O
manydifferent	O

I	O
ate	O
here	O
a	O
week	O
ago	O
and	O
found	O
most	O
dishes	B-A
	O
average	O
at	O
best	O
and	O
too	O
expensive.	O

Everything	O
is	O
delicious,	O
though,	O
my	O

and	O
I	O
come	O
here	O
once	O
a	O
week	O
sometimes-	O
you	O
will	O
get	O
addicted!	O

And	O
I	O
could	O
do	O
without	O
the	O
cigar	O
smoke.	O

Still,	O
try	O
it	O
once,	O
since	O
if	O
you	O
end	O
up	O
loving	O
the	O
food	B-A
,	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
one	O
of	O
your	O

I've	O
waited	O
over	O

The	O

Both	O

I	O
was	O
extremely	O

by	O
the	O

which	O

The	O

Tuna	B-A

huge	O
and	O
probably	O
the	O
best	O
that	O
I've	O
had	O
at	O
this	O

.	O

Price	B-A
	O

	O
of	O

will	O
keep	O
us	O
from	O

Our	O
waiter	B-A
	O
and	O
all	O
of	O
the	O

him	O
were	O
attentive	O

The	O

the	O

Overall,	O
the	O

	O
are	O
there	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
encouraged	O
enough	O
to	O
return	O
at	O
lunch	B-A
	O
or	O
dinner	B-A
	O
to	O
see	O
whether	O
the	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
huge	O
pastrami	B-A

	O
on	O
a	O
roll.	O

Though	O
you	O
will	O
undoubtedly	O
be	O
seated	O
at	O
a	O
table	B-A
	O
with	O
what	O
seems	O
like	O
barely	O
enough	O
room	B-A
	O
(no	O
matter	O
what	O
the	O
size	O
of	O
your	O

the	O
warm	O

is	O
worth	O
the	O

you'll	O
have	O
fun	O
and	O
forgot	O
about	O
the	O
tight	O
spot	B-A
	O
you're	O
in.	O

The	O
fish	B-A
	O
was	O
not	O
fresh	O
and	O
the	O
rice	B-A
	O
tasted	O
old	O
and	O
stale.	O

Considering	O
their	O
price	B-A
	O
of	O
$6.25	O
for	O
lunch	B-A
special	I-A
,	O
the	O
dish	B-A

was	O
ridiculously	O
small.	O

This	O

the	O
pinnacle	O
of	O
Indian	B-A
Fast	I-A
Food	I-A
	O
(all	O
fast	O
foods	O
in	O
my	O

Besides,	O
when	O
you	O
have	O
bad	O

that's	O
less	O
money	B-A
	O
you	O
have	O

We	O
do	O
not	O

The	O

The	O

discreet.	O

As	O
a	O
retired	O
hipster,	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
with	O
some	O
degree	O
of	O
certainty	O
that	O
for	O
the	O
last	O
year	O
Lucky	O
Strike	O
has	O
been	O
the	O
best	O
laid-back	O
late	O
night	O
in	O
the	O
city.	O

For	O
those	O
prices	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
dressed	O
up	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
you	O
expect	O
more	O
and	O
should	O
get	O
more.	O

Then,	O
IF	O
they	O
answer	O
the	O
phone,	O
you're	O
lucky	O
if	O
they	O
don't	O
hang	O
up	O
on	O
you!	O

They	O
offer	O
the	O
same	O
menu	B-A
	O
but	O
have	O
creative	O
drinks	B-A
	O
that	O
are	O
loaded	O
with	O
alcohol	O
and	O
cheeky	O
names	O

but	O
they	O
do	O

you.	O

We	O
went	O
to	O
eat	O
at	O
the	O
Jekyll	O
and	O
Hyde	O
restaurant	O
on	O
Friday	O
night	O
and	O
really	O
enjoyed	O
the	O
fun	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
and	O
good	O
food	B-A
.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
pretty	O
tradional	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
hot	O
and	O
good	O
with	O
large	O
portions	B-A
.	O

Highly	O
recommended	O
to	O
all!	O

highly	O

Unless	O
you	O
are	O

in	O
the	O
Pizzeria	O
side	O
of	O
this	O
place	B-A
,	O
and	O
are	O
not	O
in	O
a	O
rush,	O
this	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
a	O
bad	O
idea.	O

You	O
have	O
to	O
increase	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
a	O
lot.	O

Ambiance	B-A
	O
is	O
barely	O
romantic	O
but	O
management	B-A
	O
tries.	O

I	O
must	O
warn	O
the	O
reader	O
that	O
the	O
portions	B-A
	O
sizes	O
are	O
very	O
small	O
(especially	O
the	O

),	O
so	O
if	O
you	O
plan	O
to	O
eat	O
until	O
you	O

and	O
the	O
cold	B-A
udon	I-A
	O
at	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

They	O
were	O
very	O
abrupt	O
with	O
me	O
when	O
I	O
called	O
and	O
actually	O
claimed	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
late	O
because	O
they	O
were	O
out	O
of	O
rice	B-A
.	O

After	O
we	O
got	O
our	O
sashimi	B-A
	O
order,	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
believe	O
how	O
small	O
the	O
portions	B-A
	O
were!	O

After	O
the	O
main	B-A
course	I-A
	O
came,	O
we	O
didn't	O
see	O
our	O
waiter	B-A
	O
for	O
at	O

40	O
MINUTES!	O

It	O
will	O
be	O
on	O
my	O
to	O
do	O
list	O
the	O
next	O
visit	O
to	O
NYC.	O

Nothing	O
better	O
than	O
buying	O
a	O
snapple	B-A
	O
for	O
$3.25	O
too.	O

When	O
family	O
came	O
in	O
he	O
gave	O
them	O
apps	B-A
	O
to	O
test	O
their	O
palets,	O
and	O
then	O
ordered	O
for	O
them.	O

I	O
was	O
pleasantly	O
surprised	O
to	O
find	O
this	O
gem	O
in	O
Hoboken.	O

Service	B-A
	O
is	O
extraordinary,	O
yet	O
not	O
overbearing,	O
and	O
the	O
decor	B-A
	O
brings	O
a	O
taste	O
of	O
trendy	O
SoHo	O
into	O
Queens.	O

The	O
dosas	B-A
	O
are	O
skimpy,	O
unattractive	O
and	O
drip	O
with	O
grease,	O
and	O
personally	O
I'd	O
drink	O
popcorn	B-A
topping	I-A
	O
before	O
I'd	O
eat	O
another	O
one	O
of	O
these.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
excellent	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
delicious.	O

If	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
a	O
crappy	O
scene	B-A
	O
and	O
annoying	O
customers	B-A
	O
I'd	O
go	O
out	O
in	O
Manhattan.	O

After	O
a	O
seafood	B-A
	O
craving,	O
i	O
checked	O
citysearch	O
and	O
chose	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Fish	O
based	O
on	O
a	O
previous	O
review	O
and	O
the	O
citysearch	O

Right	O
off	O
the	O
major	O
deegan	O
you	O
get	O
ladies	B-A
	O
from	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
city.	O

Until	O
you	O
realize	O
that	O
their	O
five	O
minutes	O
is	O
meaningless	O
and	O
your	O
wait	B-A
	O
may	O
be	O
anywhere	O
from	O
two	O
to	O
twenty	O
minutes	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
frustrating.	O

always	O
fresh	O
and	O
delicious.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
good,	O
but	O
not	O
very	O
thai.	O

Thalia	O
is	O
a	O
beautiful	O
restaurant	O
with	O
beautiful	O
people	B-A
serving	I-A
	O
you,	O
but	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
doesn't	O
quite	O
match	O
up.	O

The	O
fillings	B-A
	O
may	O
be	O
unconventional	O
but	O
the	O
dosa	B-A
batter	I-A
	O
is	O
definitely	O
authentic	O
and	O
the	O
combinations	O
very	O
tasty.	O

This	O
is	O
the	O

	O
for	O

This	O
is	O
a	O

to	O
go	O
to.	O

The	O
mussaman	B-A
curry	I-A
	O
that	O
I	O
ordered	O
was	O
as	O
thin	O
as	O
water	O
and	O
aside	O
from	O
the	O
poorly	O
fried	B-A
tofu	I-A
	O
that	O
I	O
ordered	O
in	O
it,	O
they	O
graciously	O
provided	O
me	O
with	O
ONE	O
piece	O
of	O
poorly	O
cooked	O
potato	B-A
.	O

Had	O
a	O
late	O
night	O
dinner	B-A
	O
on	O
a	O
Saturday	O
night.	O

A	O
restaurant	O
that	O
doesn't	O
try	O
to	O
do	O
anything	O
except	O
serve	O
great	O
food	B-A
	O
with	O
great	O
service	B-A
	O
in	O
a	O
pleasant	O
atmosphere	B-A

Their	O
sake	B-A
martini	I-A
	O
is	O
wonderful.	O

Well,	O
this	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
so	O
Ghetto	O
its	O
not	O
even	O
funny.	O

Bravissimo	O
!!	O

Once	O
they	O
ran	O
out	O
of	O
Gnochi	B-A
	O
and	O
made	O
it	O
for	O
me	O
from	O
scratch!	O

We	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
thank	O
Marcelo	O
and	O
Grace	O
for	O
a	O
wonderful	O
dining	B-A
	O
experience!!!	O

Found	O
service	B-A
	O
above	O
average,	O
but	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
because	O
we	O
were	O
13	O
of	O
us.	O

When	O
I	O
arrived	O
at	O
Orsay	O
I	O
was	O
thrown	O
back,	O
in	O
a	O
veyr	O
good	O
sense.	O

Bagels	B-A
	O
are	O
ok,	O
but	O
be	O
sure	O
not	O
to	O
make	O
any	O

This	O

the	O
Cheers	O
of	O
New	O

whether	O
you've	O
ever	O
been	O
there	O
or	O
not.	O

It's	O
to	O
die	O
for!	O

Cute	O
and	O
decorative.	O

I	O
know	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
case	O
in	O
many	O
nyc	O
eateries,	O
but	O
here,	O
they	O
really	O
cram	O
you	O
in	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
where	O
it's	O
borderline	O
uncomfortable.	O

fine	O
dining	O
restaurant	O
quality	B-A
.	O

Overall	O
a	O
disappointing	O
experience	O
for	O
that	O
price	B-A
	O
category.	O

I've	O
had	O
the	O
lunch	B-A
buffet	I-A
	O
at	O
Chennai	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
times,	O
when	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
in	O
the	O
neighborhood.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
exceptional.	O

You	O
will	O
be	O
satisfied.	O

Another	O
great	O
place	O
to	O
take	O
out-of-towners!	O

But,	O
hey,	O
there	O
is	O
anything	O
better	O
with	O
a	O
decent	O
vegetarian	O
selection	O
in	O
Astoria.	O

We	O
were	O
less	O
than	O
impressed.	O

A	O
Thai	O
restaurant	O
out	O
of	O
rice	B-A
	O
during	O
dinner	B-A
?	O

but	O
still	O
my	O
date	O
was	O
bad	O

Would	O
definitely	O
go	O
back	O
again.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
to	O
Rao's	O
probably	O
15	O
times	O
the	O
past	O
3	O
years	O
and	O
it	O
keeps	O
getting	O
better.	O

The	O
portions	B-A
	O
are	O
small	O
but	O
being	O
that	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
so	O
good	O
makes	O
up	O
for	O
that.	O

(and	O
I	O
have	O
eaten	O
my	O
share)	O
Which	O
impresses	O
me	O
for	O
having	O
such	O
a	O
large	O
amount	O
of	O
people	O
to	O
serve	B-A
.	O

Sure,	O
the	O
setting	B-A
	O
is	O
nice.	O

Overall	O
a	O
worthwhile	O
experience.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O

if	O
not	O
the	O
most	O
prompt	O
in	O
the	O
world,	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
great,	O
and	O
the	O
prices	B-A
,	O
while	O
not	O
cheap,	O
won't	O
put	O
your	O
wallet	O
out	O
of	O

	O
and	O
the	O
bill	B-A
	O
was	O
~$55.00,	O
not	O

It's	O
really	O
a	O
takeaway	O
place,	O
I	O
wouldn't	O
sit	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
take	O
it	O

THE	O

in	O
the	O

not	O
one	O

for	O
anything.	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
experience.	O

The	O
chicken	B-A
parm	I-A
	O
was	O
edible	O
but	O
had	O
canned	O
tomato	B-A
sauce	I-A
	O
and	O
boxed	O
pasta	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
chicken	B-A
with	I-A
portobello	I-A
mushrooms	I-A
	O
consisted	O
of	O
dry,	O
inedible	O
chicken	B-A
	O
with	O
terrible	O
sauce	B-A
.	O

I	O
recommend	O
this	O
place	O
to	O
everyone	O
who	O
asks	O
me	O
where	O
to	O
go	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
meal	B-A

The	O

	O
are	O
nice--also	O
you	O
can	O
just	O
get	O
counter	B-A
service	I-A
	O

The	O
only	O

	O
was	O
the	O

the	O

Having	O

I	O
was	O
surpised	O
to	O
find	O
myself	O
return	O
time	O
and	O
time	O
again	O
to	O
Murray's.	O

Go	O
for	O
it!	O

Highly	O
recommended.	O

You	O
can	O
certainly	O
find	O
restaurants	O
that	O
offer	O
a	O
superior	O
fine	O
dining	O
experience,	O
but	O
for	O
superb	O
food	B-A
	O
at	O
reasonable	O
prices	B-A
,	O
La	O

can't	O

Won't	O
or	O
Can't	O
is	O

I	O
cannot	O
imagine	O
a	O
friendlier	O
staff	B-A
	O
working	O
in	O
a	O
restaurant.	O

I	O
do	O
suggest	O
to	O
ask	O
to	O
be	O
seated	O
upstairs	B-A
	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
looking	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
cozy.	O

To	O
speak	O
of	O
the	O
Park	O
Side,	O
words	O
can	O
not	O
describe.	O

The	O
red	B-A
curry	I-A
	O
is	O
weak	O
and	O
tasteless,	O
the	O
pad	B-A
thai	I-A
	O
is	O
stuck	O
together	O
and	O
lumpy,	O
the	O
rice	B-A
	O
is	O
often	O
overcooked,	O
and	O
the	O
seafood	B-A
	O
is	O
pretty	O
sketchy.	O

The	O
wine	B-A
list	I-A
	O
is	O
extensive	O
and	O
can	O
easily	O
hike	O
up	O
an	O
otherwise	O
reasonably	O
priced	B-A
	O
meal	B-A
.	O

Saul	B-A
	O
is	O
pretty	O
good,	O
but	O
definitely	O
not	O
great.	O

I	O
would	O
recommend	O
Roxy's	O
for	O
that,	O
but	O
not	O
for	O
their	O
food	B-A
.	O

We	O
always	O
get	O
a	O
sampling	O
of	O
appetizers	B-A
	O
and	O
share.	O

Overall	O
I	O
was	O
impressed	O
and	O
will	O
return,	O
it's	O
a	O
great	O
QPR	O
(Quality	B-A
	O
to	O
Price	B-A
	O
Ratio).	O

It	O
is	O
nearly	O
impossible	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
table	B-A
,	O
so	O
if	O
you	O
ever	O
have	O
the	O
chance	O
to	O
go	O
here	O
for	O
dinner	B-A
,	O
DO	O
NOT	O
pass	O
it	O
up.	O

Their	O
pad	B-A
penang	I-A
	O
is	O
delicious	O
and	O
everything	O
else	O
is	O
fantastic.	O

The	O
puke	O
green	O
walls	B-A
	O
leave	O
a	O
lot	O
to	O
be	O
desired,	O
but	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
good.	O

The	O
flavors	B-A
	O
are	O
very	O
fresh	O
and	O
pretty	O
inobtrusive,	O
nothing	O
flashy.	O

I	O
like	O
Cafe	O
Noir	O
dont	O
get	O
me	O
wrong,	O
it	O
is	O
jsut	O
that	O
the	O
people	B-A
	O
who	O
work	O
there	O
are	O
evil	O
and	O

The	O
hanger	B-A
steak	I-A
	O
was	O
like	O
rubber	O
and	O
the	O
tuna	B-A
	O
was	O
flavorless	O
not	O
to	O
mention	O
it	O
tasted	O
like	O
it	O
had	O
just	O
been	O
thawed.	O

Our	O

pizza	B-A
	O
and	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
certified	O
Neapolitan	O
pizzaria	O
in	O
our	O
home	O
city	O
(Seattle),	O
we	O
liked	O
this	O
nearly	O
as	O
much	O
-	O
and	O
the	O
differences	O
were	O
more	O
about	O
personal	O
preference	O
than	O
any	O
reflection	O
on	O
either	O
restaurant.	O

big	O
and	O
soft	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
good	O
lunch	B-A
food	I-A
.	O

No	O
food	B-A
	O
snobs	O
allowed,	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
for	O
people	O
who	O
appreciate	O
good	O
food	B-A
.	O

I	O
liked	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
at	O
this	O
quasi-thai	B-A
	O
restaurant.	O

By	O
far	O
the	O
best	O
salad	B-A
	O
I	O
have	O
had	O
in	O
a	O
fast	B-A
food	I-A
	O
restaurant.	O

Suan	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
place	O
that	O
I	O
often	O
take	O
my	O
friends	O
(classmates)	O
too.	O

Not	O
a	O
great	O
place	O
for	O
family	O
or	O
general	O
dining.	O

As	O
for	O
the	O
bar	B-A
,	O
this	O
is	O
another	O
bad	O
idea.	O

Their	O
bagels	B-A
	O
are	O
fine,	O
but	O
they	O
are	O
a	O
little	O
overcooked,	O
and	O
not	O
really	O
a	O
'special'	O
bagel	B-A
	O
experience.	O

Unlike	O
HH	O
up	O
the	O
block,	O
this	O
place	O
actually	O
gives	O
you	O
hearty	O
and	O
hot	O
bagels	B-A
	O
this	O
town	O
is	O
known	O
for.	O

I	O
thought	O
going	O
to	O
Jimmys	O
would	O
give	O
me	O
a	O
real	O
Domincan	O
exprience.	O

The	O
barebecued	B-A
salmon	I-A
	O
is	O
elegantly	O
spiced	O
and	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
dry.	O

Same	O
owner	B-A
	O
as	O
the	O
guy	O
who	O
owns	O
Typhoon,	O
which	O
is	O
just	O
down	O
the	O
street	O
on	O
St.	O
Marks	O
and	O
1st	O
Ave.	O

What	O
generous	O
portions	B-A
!	O

The	O
workers	B-A
	O
there	O
also	O
absolutely	O
load	O
the	O
bagel	B-A
	O
with	O
cream	B-A
cheese	I-A
	O
(gets	O
a	O
little	O
messy).	O

I	O
was	O
wrong.	O

The	O
wine	B-A
	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
too.	O

So,	O
the	O
menu	B-A
	O
is	O
written	O
in	O
chalk	O
above	O
your	O
head	O
and	O
it	O
all	O
sounds	O
delicious.	O

The	O
highly	O
spiced	O
chai	B-A
tea	I-A
	O
was	O
great	O
too.	O

No	O
plans	O
to	O
return	O
anytime	O
soon.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
there	O
many	O
times,	O
and	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
good	O
and	O
consistent.	O

Seriously,	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
all	O
you	O
can	O
eat	O
in	O
town-	O
As	O
everyone	O
says,	O
the	O
Spicy	B-A
Tuna	I-A
hand	I-A
rolls	I-A
	O
are	O
the	O
best-	O
have	O
4	O
of	O
these,	O
and	O
you've	O
broken	O
even.	O

There	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
single	O
place	O
in	O
Chinatown	O
where	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
nice	O
neighborhood	O
feeling	O
like	O
here.	O

While	O
Sapphire	O
is	O
certainly	O
not	O
lacking	O
in	O
ambiance	B-A
,	O
and	O
probably	O
has	O
the	O
best	O
decor	B-A
	O
of	O
any	O
Indian	O
restaurant	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
to	O
in	O
New	O
York	O
City,	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
not	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
hoped	O
for.	O

I	O
would	O
highly	O
recommend	O
this	O
place	O
to	O
anyone	O
looking	O
for	O
a	O
casual	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
that	O
whisks	O
you	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
left	O
bank	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
Seine.	O

I	O
just	O
do	O
not	O
understand	O
what	O
the	O
fuss	O
is	O
all	O
about.	O

The	O
meat	B-A
dishes	I-A
	O
were	O
only	O
so-so.	O

His	O
wife	O
Tanya,	O
the	O
hostess	B-A
,	O
completes	O
the	O
comforting	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
by	O
being	O
delightfully	O
warm	O
and	O
gracious.	O

We	O
liked	O
it	O
so	O
much,	O
that	O
we	O
will	O
always	O
make	O
it	O
a	O
point	O
to	O
dine	O
here	O
when	O
we	O
visit	O
New	O
York.	O

The	O
menu	B-A
	O
consisted	O
of	O
standard	O
brassiere	B-A
food	I-A
,	O
better	O
then	O
places	O
like	O
Balthazar	O
etc.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
longtime	O
fan	O
of	O
Holy	O
Basil	O
in	O
the	O
East	O
Village,	O
and	O
while	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
their	O
food	B-A
	O
has	O
slightly	O
slipped	O
in	O
quality	B-A
,	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
hesitant	O
to	O
be	O
disloyal.	O

But	O
the	O
best	O
part	O
about	O
LS	O
is	O
the	O
late	O
night	O
atmosphere	B-A
,	O
delightfully	O
free	O
of	O
the	O
BTs.	O

For	O
an	O
untrendy	O
rip-off-	O
eat	O
here.	O

And	O
you're	O
hungry	O
a	O
few	O
hours	O
later.	O

I	O
can't	O
wait	O
to	O
go	O
back.	O

I	O
HATE	O
HATE	O
HATE	O
this	O
place.	O

We	O
even	O
had	O
a	O
visit	O
from	O
the	O
Manager	B-A
	O
who	O
wanted	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
we	O
were	O
enjoying	O
ourselves.	O

The	O
staff	B-A
	O
there	O
is	O
very	O
attentive	O
and	O
down	O
to	O
earth.	O

You	O
don't	O
go	O
to	O
Mizu	O
for	O
excellent	O
service	B-A
,	O
you	O
go	O
for	O
the	O
large	O
amounts	O
of	O
food	B-A
,	O
the	O
amiable	O
atmosphere	B-A
,	O
and	O
the	O
hole-in-the-wall	O
feeling	O
of	O
the	O
place.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
always	O
bad	O
though,	O
don't	O
expect	O
much	O
of	O
anything	O
from	O
your	O
server	B-A
,	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
recommend	O
bringing	O
a	O
date	O
here	O
either.	O

Monday	O

of	I-A

Wonderful!	O

It	O
took	O
them	O
15	O
minutes	O
to	O
put	O
water	B-A
	O
in	O
our	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
descent	O
even	O
when	O
this	O
small	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
packed.	O

This	O

the	O

I	O
have	O
eaten	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O

This	O
place	O
is	O
worth	O
an	O
one-hour	O
drive.	O

Great	O
value	O
for	O
the	O
quality	O
ingredients	B-A
.	O

The	O
Thali	B-A
	O
was	O
small,	O
thoroughly	O
unremarkable,	O
and	O
$14.95.	O

The	O

	O
to	O
a	O
dessert	B-A
	O
that	O
I	O
can't	O
remember	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
fabulous	O
Cakebread	B-A
Cabernet	I-A
	O
we	O
were	O
drinking	O
--	O
the	O
whole	O
evening	O
was	O
amazing.	O

Truly	O
the	O
mark	O
of	O
an	O
attentive	O
waiter	B-A
.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
here	O
is	O
rather	O
good,	O
but	O
only	O
if	O
you	O
like	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
it.	O

I	O
got	O
an	O
excellent	O
piece	O
of	O
cheesecake	B-A
	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
several	O
other	O
nice	O
pastries	B-A
.	O

The	O
staff	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
kind	O
and	O
well	O
trained,	O
they're	O
fast,	O
they	O
are	O
always	O
prompt	O
to	O
jump	O
behind	O
the	O
bar	B-A
	O
and	O
fix	O
drinks	B-A
,	O
they	O
know	O
details	O
of	O
every	O
item	O
in	O
the	O
menu	B-A
	O
and	O
make	O
excelent	O
recomendations.	O

The	O
makhani	B-A
	O
was	O
OK	O
--the	O
korma	B-A
	O
was	O
bland.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
inventive	O
but	O
still	O
keeps	O
traditional	O
indian	O
flavoring.	O

All	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
is	O
WOW!	O

though	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
could	O
be	O
better	O
(possibly	O
due	O
to	O
more	O
than	O
one	O
very	O
large	O
group	O
in	O
the	O
house),	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
cordial	O
and	O
warm,	O
as	O
is	O
the	O
general	O
clientele.	O

The	O
decor	B-A
	O
in	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
very	O
diner-ish	O
and	O
the	O
kind	O
of	O
place	B-A
	O
you	O
expect	O
in	O
the	O
East	O
Village	O
-	O
not	O
romantic,	O
just	O
simple,	O
small	O
and	O
sparse.	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
cute	O
place	B-A
	O
and	O
could	O
be	O
good	O
but	O
they	O
need	O
to	O
get	O
their	O
act	O
together.	O

The	O
lox	B-A
	O
is	O
always	O
fresh	O
too.	O

Sure	O
enough,	O
exactly	O
30	O
minutes	O
later	O
we	O
got	O
the	O
call	O
and	O
were	O
seated	O
promptly.	O

Service	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
friendly.	O

So	O
all	O
I'm	O
trying	O
to	O
say	O
is	O
this	O
restaurant	O
is	O
by	O
far	O
the	O
best	O
thai	B-A
food	I-A
	O
restaurant	O
I've	O
ever	O
been	O
to.	O

Food	B-A
	O
was	O
OK	O
-	O
fish	B-A
	O
was	O
cooked	O
well.	O

We	O
actually	O
left	O
hungry	O
and	O
went	O
across	O
the	O
street	O
to	O
Wo	O
Hop	O
at	O
15	O
Mott	O
street	O
for	O
some	O
good	O
chinese	B-A
food	I-A
.	O

The	O
duck	B-A
confit	I-A
	O
is	O
always	O
amazing	O
and	O
the	O
foie	B-A
gras	I-A
terrine	I-A
with	I-A
figs	I-A
	O
was	O
out	O
of	O
this	O
world.	O

The	O
whole	O
set	O
up	O
is	O
truly	O
unprofessional	O
and	O
I	O
wish	O
Cafe	O
Noir	O
would	O
get	O
some	O
good	O
staff	B-A
,	O
because	O
despite	O
the	O
current	O
one	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
place.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
does	O
sometimes	O
lack	O
focus	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
ideal	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
in	O
a	O
hurry	O
but	O
I	O
have	O
never	O
been	O
treated	O
rudely.	O

The	O
staff	B-A
	O
offers	O
impeccable	O
service	B-A
.	O

The	O
catch	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
are	O
charged	O
extra	O
for	O
ANYTHING	O
that	O
you	O
leave	O
on	O
your	O
plate	O
so	O
don't	O
be	O
a	O
greedy	O
pig!	O

We	O
ended	O
our	O
great	O
experience	O
by	O
having	O
Gulab	B-A
Jamun	I-A
(dessert)	I-A
	O
recommended	O
by	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
.	O

wont	O
come	O
back	O
again	O
for	O
sure!	O

i	O
went	O
to	O
utsav	O
about	O
a	O
yr	O
ago	O
with	O
my	O
family.	O

This	O
place	O
doesn't	O
compare	O
with	O
Mamoun's	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
price	B-A
,	O
freshness	B-A
,	O
value	B-A
,	O
and	O
consisent	O
quality	B-A
,	O
but	O
that's	O
just	O
my	O
opinion.	O

The	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
sleek,	O
modern	O
and	O
playfull	O
and	O
i	O
will	O
return	O
again	O
frequently.	O

I	O
have	O
known	O
about	O
this	O
secret	O
for	O
the	O
last	O
13	O
years,	O
Emilio(the	O
Godfather)	O
has	O
continued	O
to	O
serve	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
wine	B-A
	O
for	O
the	O
gods	O
at	O
mortal	O
prices	B-A
.	O

The	O
brioche	B-A
and	I-A
lollies	I-A
	O
as	O
party	O
favors	O
is	O
a	O
cute	O
and	O
sweet	O
touch	O
to	O
a	O
most	O
memorable	O
meal	B-A
.	O

After	O
being	O
told	O
that	O
our	O
party	O
of	O
three	O
would	O
be	O
seated	O
in	O
10	O
minutes	O
and	O
watching	O
other	O
parties	O
(multiples	O
of	O
2	O

seated	O
for	O
40	O
minutes,	O
the	O
three	O
of	O
us	O
were	O
squished	O
into	O
a	O
small	O
2-person	B-A
table	I-A
.	O

And	O
the	O
bill	B-A
	O
was	O
outragous.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
attentive,	O
yet	O
unimposing,	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
far	O
better	O
than	O
many	O
notorious	O
restaurants	O
in	O
Midtown	O
and	O
the	O
wine	B-A
list	I-A
	O

their	O

is	O
fantastic.	O

and	O
I	O
think	O
they	O
are	O
doing	O
it	O
the	O
best.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
yummy,	O
especially	O
their	O
cooked-to-perfection	O

A	O
great	O
addition	O
to	O
Smith	O

finally,	O
a	O

that's	O
not	O

We	O
spent	O
$200	O
in	O
this	O
place	O
and	O
left	O
hungry	O
and	O
very	O
disappointed.	O

It	O
is	O

I	O
complete	O
the	O
total	O
bagel	B-A
	O
experience	O
by	O
having	O
it	O
lightly	O
toasted.	O

It	O
was	O
like	O
the	O
servers	B-A
	O
forgot	O
that	O
they	O
actually	O
worked	O
there	O
and	O
instead	O
wanted	O
to	O
hang	O
out	O

A	O

way	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
good,	O
but	O
very	O
expensive	O
for	O
the	O

of	O
it.	O

The	O
only	O
fallback	O
on	O

The	O

Their	O

by	I-A
the	I-A

a	O
great	O

you	O
can	O
eat	O
like	O
a	O

without	O

believe	O
us,	O
we've	O
been	O
eating	O

	O

over	O
15	O

for	O
a	O

or	O
any	O

The	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
is	O
much	O
better	O
than	O
Sripraphai	O
(more	O
modern	O
and	O

I	O
recommend	O
to	O
anyone	O
who	O
wants	O
to	O

Definitely	O
a	O
once	O

that	O
I	O
look	O
forward	O

around	O

Anyhow,	O
we	O
were	O

to	O

as	O
long	O
as	O
we	O
wanted	O
and	O
chat,	O
which	O
was	O
nice.	O

these	O

	O
at	O
the	O

	O
that	O
are	O
the	O

in	O
the	O

A	O
defitely	O

My	O

I	O

a	O

on	O
a	O

we	O
went	O
someplace	O

first	O

We	O
all	O
ate	O

which	O

My	O

I	O
showed	O

The	O

	O
was	O
excellent	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
I	O
have	O
had	O
(I	O
tasted	O
the	O

	O
intitally	O
but	O
in	O
no	O
way	O
did	O
it	O
overwhelm	O
the	O

	O
of	O
the	O
meat	B-A

great	O
experience	O
overall.	O

PERFECT	O
FOR	O
DATES!	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
boring	O
and	O
expensive.	O

The	O
ambience	B-A
	O
is	O
pretty	O
and	O
nice	O
for	O
conversation,	O
so	O
a	O
casual	O
lunch	B-A
	O
here	O
would	O
probably	O
be	O
best.	O

Terrific	O
menu	B-A
	O
full	O
of	O
unique	O

The	O

better.	O

We	O

I	O

(I've	O

the	O

for	O
what	O

it	O
just	O
was	O
not	O
up	O

The	O

20	O

the	O

those	O

For	O

we	O

remained	O
so	O
for	O
the	O
entire	O
evening,	O
I	O
don't	O
understand	O
why	O

we	O
had	O
a	O

I	O
read	O
the	O

why	O
I	O

Beautiful	O

The	O

also	O
reasonably	O
priced	B-A
	O
for	O
NYC.	O

If	O
you	O

that,	O
it's	O
a	O

for	O
a	O

Our	O

fine,	O
the	O

	O

of	O

some	O

which,	O
I	O
would	O
love	O
to	O
know	O
where	O
they	O

The	O

	O
is	O
spectacular,	O
from	O
the	O
appitizers	B-A
	O
to	O
the	O
main	B-A

and	O
then	O
of	O

the	O

(WOW)	O
you'll	O
need	O
no	O
more.	O

The	O

so	O
check	O
out	O

the	O

Even	O
upon	O

their	O
juicy	O
pork	B-A

	O
are	O
quite	O
good	O
.	O
.	O

This	O

where	O

Everything	O

the	O

Average	O

,	O
but	O
terrible	O

The	O
space	B-A
	O
is	O
nice	O
but	O
when	O
we	O
order	O
our	O
drink	B-A
	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
for	O
a	O
surprise.	O

The	O
entire	O
place	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
treatment	O
we	O
received	O
felt	O
as	O
a	O
conveyor	O
belt.	O

Joe's	O
Pizza	O
used	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
best	O
slice	B-A
	O
until	O
this	O
pizzeria	O
opened	O
up.	O

I	O
in	O
all	O
reality	O
felt	O
as	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
just	O
gotten	O
off	O
Air	O
France	O
and	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
8th	O
District	O
in	O
Paris.	O

I	O
have	O
never	O
had	O
anything	O
like	O
it!	O

Yeah	O
the	O
crowd	O
can	O
take	O
it	O
a	O
bit	O
seriously,	O
but	O
it	O
shouldn't.	O

And	O
they	O
provided	O
a	O
delicious	O
dessert	B-A
	O
on	O
the	O
house!	O

They	O
are	O
still	O
living	O
in	O
the	O
dark	O
ages	O
and	O
do	O
not	O
have	O
an	O
answering	O
machine,	O
so	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
reservation	B-A
	O
you	O
are	O
limited.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
amazing,	O
rich	O
pastas	B-A
	O
and	O
fresh	O
doughy	O
pizza	B-A
.	O

Food	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
good,	O
but	O
not	O
what	O
I	O
would	O
consider	O
out	O
of	O
this	O
world.	O

it's	O
fabulous	O
and	O
their	O

On	O

night,	O
I	O
was	O
with	O
a	O

at	O
the	O

Food	B-A
	O
is	O
great	O
and	O
inexpensive.	O

The	O
price	B-A
	O
very	O
reasonable.	O

Dessert	B-A
	O
-	O
can't	O
be	O
missed,	O
so	O
save	O

It	O
can	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
confusing	O
as	O
to	O
where	O
one	O
goes	O
to	O
order,	O
but	O
once	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O

you	O

a	O

It	O
was	O
so	O
bad	O
I	O
actually	O
refused	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
my	O
food	B-A

I	O
recommend	O
this	O

to	O
anyone	O
who	O
enjoys	O
	O
fine	O

	O
at	O

This	O
is,	O
by	O
far,	O
my	O
favorite	O
restaurant	O
in	O
NYC	O
and	O
I	O
only	O
wish	O
it	O
were	O
more	O
affordable	O
so	O
I	O
could	O
go	O
more	O
often!	O

The	O

	O
was	O
very	O
attentive,	O
the	O
ambience	B-A
	O
lovely,	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
superb.	O

I	O
love	O
when	O
restaurants	O
think	O
using	O
fancy	O
expensive	O

	O
makes	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
fine	O
cuisine	B-A

even	O
with	O
no	O
idea	O
how	O
to	O
use	O
them.	O

THe	O
Pizza	B-A
	O
and	O
wine	B-A
	O
were	O
excellent-the	O
service	B-A

THE	O

and	O
the	O

have	O
tried	O
quite	O
a	O
few	O
different	O

this	O

the	O

the	O

some	O

took	O
about	O
five	O

to	O

The	O

I	O
will	O

vanilla	B-A
gelato	I-A
(with	I-A

,	O
which	O
were	O
tasty,	O
but	O
I	O
thought	O
a	O
bit	O
overpriced.	O

When	O
I	O
visited	O
my	O
friend	O
who	O
lives	O
in	O
the	O
Upper	O
Eastside,	O
she	O
recommended	O
that	O

We	O
ran	O
a	O

for	O
the	O

but	O
it	O
wasn't	O
a	O

to	O
get	O
our	O

immediately.	O

Kudos	O

We	O
arrived	O
on	O

our	O

	O
and	O
seated	O
promptly.The	O

I	O
plan	O
on	O
eating	O
here	O
more	O
often.	O

I	O
would	O
definitely	O
go	O
back	O
for	O
a	O
very	O
special	O
occasion,	O
but	O
not	O
for	O
regular	O
fine	O
dining	B-A
.	O

The	O
well	O
mannered,	O
pleasant	O
staff	B-A
	O
that	O
Tony	O
has	O
in	O
his	O

The	O

	O
robust	O

subtle.	O

I	O
came	O
here	O
for	O
my	O
friend's	O
birthday	O
and	O
keep	O
coming	O
back	O
ever	O
since.	O

All	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
is	O
$2	O
pints	O
during	O
happy	O
hour	O
and	O
the	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
cheapest	O
oysters	B-A
	O
you'll	O
find	O
in	O
the	O
city,	O
though	O
the	O
quality	B-A
	O
is	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
best.	O

I	O
would	O
never	O
wait	O
for	O
a	O
table	B-A
	O
to	O
eat,	O
it	O
just	O
is	O
not	O
THAT	O
great.	O

We	O
concluded	O
with	O
tiramisu	B-A
chocolate	I-A
cake	I-A
,	O
both	O
were	O
delicious.	O

The	O
counter	B-A

I	O
had	O
a	O

Service	B-A
	O
here	O
was	O
great,	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
fantastic.	O

its	O
a	O
little	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
if	O
you	O
don't	O
live	O
in	O
the	O
neighborhood,	O
but	O
definitely	O
worth	O
the	O
trip	O
from	O
wherever	O
you	O
are.	O

This	O
is	O
such	O
a	O
lovely,	O
peaceful	O
place	B-A
	O
to	O
eat	O
outside.	O

and	O
we	O
were	O
thouroughly	O
disapointed.	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
Jackel	O
and	O
Hideof	O
the	O
restaurants	O
on	O
the	O
UES.	O

The	O
sauce	B-A
	O
is	O
delicious	O
and	O
the	O
crust	B-A
	O
is	O
perfect.	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
place	O
to	O
take	O
out-of-towners,	O
and	O
perfect	O
for	O
watching	O
the	O
sunset.	O

Since	O
my	O
first	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
the	O
chance	O
to	O
have	O
brunch	B-A
	O
at	O
Orsay	O
3x.	O

You	O
will	O
pay	O
a	O
lot	O
for	O
the	O
decore	B-A
,	O
but	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
no	O
better	O
or	O
worse	O
than	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
other	O
Chinese	O
and	O
Asian	O
fusion	O
places	O
in	O
NY.	O

They	O
have	O
some	O
great	O
entrees	B-A
	O
here	O
as	O
well.	O

Our	O
teenage	O
kids	O
love	O
it,	O
too.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
not	O
consistently	O
excellent	O
--	O
just	O
decent.	O

The	O

,	O
served	B-A
	O
in	O
small	O

	O
(as	O

good	O
with	O
each	O
dish	B-A
	O
being	O
better	O
than	O
the	O
next.	O

You	O
guys	O
are	O
awesome!	O

They	O
do	O
cater	B-A
	O
to	O
American	O
palates,	O
but	O
if	O
you	O
like	O
it	O
hot	O
let	O
them	O
know	O
and	O
they	O
are	O
more	O
than	O
willing	O
to	O
oblige!	O

I	O
loved	O
this	O
place!!	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
mango	B-A
chicken	I-A
	O
and	O
i	O
can't	O
go	O
on	O
to	O
tell	O
you	O
how	O
delicious	O
that	O
was	O
and	O
the	O
presentation	B-A
	O
was	O
beatiful.	O

I	O
care	O
more	O
about	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
ambience	B-A
.	O

Oh,	O
but	O
wait,	O
we	O
were	O
out	O
of	O
drinks	B-A
	O
(which	O
were	O
also	O
delightfully	O
overpriced).	O

Avoid	O
at	O
all	O
costs.	O

I	O
would	O
highly	O
recommend	O
this	O
place	O
to	O
everyone	O
for	O
any	O
occasion!	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
fantastic.	O

I	O
recommend	O
that	O
you	O
try	O
this	O
hidden	O
spot	O
which	O
will	O
surely	O
blowup	O
very	O
soon	O

The	O
garlic	B-A
mashed	I-A
potatoes	I-A
	O
are	O
hands	O
down	O
the	O
best	O
in	O
the	O
city!	O

Food	B-A
	O
and	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
okay.	O

great	O
for	O
a	O
romantic	O
evening,	O
or	O
a	O
fun	O
evening	O
with	O
friends...	O

The	O
lamb	B-A
meat	I-A
	O
was	O
under-cooked	O
and	O
EXTRMELY	O
CHEWY.	O

The	O
best	O
pad	B-A
thai	I-A
	O
i've	O
ever	O
had.	O

Over	O
time,	O
the	O
food	B-A
quality	I-A
	O
has	O
decreased	O
substantially,	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
lot	O
less	O
crowded	O
than	O
it	O
used	O
to,	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
must	O
definitely	O
be	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
reason.	O

Great	O
pizza	B-A
	O
and	O
fantastic	O
service	B-A
.	O

We	O
were	O
seated	O
outside	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
	O
spilled	O
red	B-A
wine	I-A
	O
and	O
hot	B-A
tea	I-A
	O
on	O
myself	O
and	O
my	O
date.	O

i	O
would	O
just	O
ask	O
for	O
no	O
oil	B-A
	O
next	O
time.	O

While	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
pretty	O
place	B-A
	O
in	O
that	O
overly	O
cute	O
French	O
way,	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
insultingly	O
horrible.	O

I	O
went	O
there	O
for	O
lunch	B-A
	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
I	O
expected	O
from	O
the	O
reviews	O
I	O
read.	O

I	O
really	O
didn't	O
know	O
what	O
to	O
expect	O
for	O
a	O
restaurant	O
that	O
literally	O
overlooks	O
the	O
main	O
hall	O
of	O
Grand	O
Central.	O

None	O
of	O
that	O
yucky	O
whipped	O
stuff.	O

The	O
wine	B-A
list	I-A
	O
isn't	O
great,	O
and	O
the	O
desserts	B-A
	O
are	O
shipped	O
in	O
from	O
Bruno's	O
down	O
the	O
street,	O
which	O
is	O
not	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
it	O
used	O
to	O
be.	O

I	O
ordered	O
a	O
Lassi	B-A
	O
and	O
asked	O
4	O
times	O
for	O
it	O
but	O
never	O
got	O
it.	O

Their	O
coffee	B-A
	O
is	O
quite	O
good	O
too!	O

I	O
would	O
not	O
recommend	O
this	O
place	O
to	O
anyone.	O

great	O

list	I-A
	O
(italian),	O
good	O
food	B-A
,	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
INITIALLY	O
fine.	O

Despite	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
space	B-A
	O
is	O
large,	O
they've	O
overcrowded	O
the	O

with	O

i	O
know,	O
you	O
were	O
too	O
busy	O
showing	O
off	O
your	O
vintage	O
tee	O

and	O
looking	O
bored,	O
but	O
my	O
agenda	O
is	O
i'm	O
here	O
to	O
eat	O
and	O
enjoy	O
the	O
company	O
of	O

seeking	O
a	O

As	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
goes,	O
the	O
waitresses	B-A
	O
were	O
not	O
particularly	O
friendly,	O
but	O
they	O
got	O
the	O
job	O
done.	O

They	O
are	O
not	O
helpful	O
in	O
the	O
least	O
and	O
will	O
give	O
you	O
the	O
grand	O
run	O
around	O
so	O
by	O
the	O
time	O
the	O
event	O

rolls	O
around	O
you	O
will	O
not	O
only	O
regret	O
chosing	O
this	O
place	B-A

but	O
also	O
become	O
hostile!	O

I	O
had	O
to	O
ask	O
her	O
three	O
times	O
before	O
she	O
finally	O
came	O
back	O
with	O
the	O
dish	B-A
	O
Ive	O
requested.	O

Normally	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
improper,	O
however	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
delicious	O
and	O
my	O
host	B-A
	O
did	O
not	O
complain.	O

Taxan	B-A
	O
delicious!	O

Perhaps	O
it	O
was	O
an	O
off	O

it	O
was	O
suprisingly	O
average	O
for	O
a	O

in	O

where	O
the	O

	O
you	O

dozens	O

to	O

They	O
couldn't	O
even	O

	O
that	O
was	O
appealing.	O

Of	O

the	O
reason	O
its	O
so	O

is	O
because	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
so	O
delicious!	O

Staffs	B-A
	O
are	O
not	O
that	O
friendly,	O
but	O
the	O
taste	B-A

all.	O

The	O

	O
plays	O
everything	O
from	O
Italian	O

to	O
The	O

And	O
I've	O
been	O
to	O
many	O
NYC	O
delis.	O

This	O
place	O
is	O
always	O
packed.	O

Much	O
of	O
the	O
time	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
care	O
about	O
you.	O

Plus	O
they	O
made	O
a	O
perfect	O
martini	B-A
.	O

I	O
am	O
not	O
sure	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
call	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
here	O
Indian	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
fusion	O
of	O
what	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
French	O
with	O
an	O
Indian	O
or	O
exotic	O
touch.	O

I've	O
eaten	O
thai	O
many	O
times,	O
and	O
am	O
very	O
familiar	O
with	O
the	O
cuisine	B-A
.	O

The	O
waiter	B-A
	O
was	O
attentive.	O

Their	O
Margarita	B-A
	O
is	O
best	O
I've	O
had	O
since	O
I've	O
returned	O
from	O
Naples!	O

I	O
highly	O
recommend	O
the	O
restaurant	O
based	O
on	O
our	O
experience	O
last	O
night.	O

The	O
tastes	B-A
	O
makes	O
your	O
mouth	O
water	O
for	O
more.	O

I	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
city	O
to	O
try	O
out	O
this	O
restaurant	O
because	O
a	O
friend	O
had	O
recommended	O
it	O
to	O
my	O
husband.	O

Their	O
sake	B-A
list	I-A
	O
was	O
extensive,	O
but	O
we	O
were	O
looking	O
for	O
Purple	B-A
Haze	I-A
,	O
which	O
wasn't	O
listed	O
but	O
made	O
for	O
us	O
upon	O
request!	O

The	O
tables	B-A
	O
are	O
crammed	O
way	O
too	O
close,	O
the	O
menu	B-A
	O
is	O
typical	O
of	O
any	O
Italian	O
restaurant,	O
and	O
the	O
wine	B-A
list	I-A
	O
is	O
simply	O
overpriced.	O

All	O
in	O
all	O
a	O
wonderful	O
experience,	O
can't	O
wait	O
to	O
come	O
back.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
actually	O
aweful.	O

after	O
dining	O
at	O
B.O.G	O
over	O
twenty	O
times	O
now,	O
its	O
official	O
!	O

They	O
are	O

	O
with	O
a	O
free	O
appetizer	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
portions	B-A
	O
are	O

There	O
is	O

the	O

We	O
went	O
around	O
9:30	O
on	O
a	O
Friday	O
and	O
it	O
had	O
died	O
down	O
a	O
bit	O

so	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
great!	O

My	O
husband	O
and	O
I	O
both	O
ordered	O
the	O
Steak	B-A
,	O
medium.	O

Furthermore,	O
the	O
rice	B-A
	O
had	O
no	O
seasoning	B-A
,	O
so	O
the	O
sushi	B-A
	O
was	O
bland	O
and	O
disgusting.	O

This	O
place	O
has	O
realy	O
fresh	O
sushi	B-A
	O
and	O
a	O
nice	O
large	O
menu	B-A
	O
of	O
Japanese	B-A

The	O
sushi	B-A
	O
is	O
average	O
and	O
the	O
prices	B-A
	O
are	O
anything	O
but.	O

My	O
wife	O
and	O
I	O
also	O
enjoyed	O
the	O

the	O
Shanghai	B-A
low	I-A

,	O
and	O
other	O

this	O

credit.	O

Turned	O
out	O
there	O
was	O
full	O

upstairs	O
and	O
sat	O
down.	O

I	O
would	O
go	O
back.	O

Definitely	O
will	O
be	O
back!	O

Several	O
of	O
the	O
dim	B-A
sum	I-A

6-8	O

I'm	O

why	O
these	O

whining	O
so	O
much.	O

they	O
live	O
up	O

If	O

I've	O
been	O
coming	O
here	O
for	O
years,	O
and	O
the	O
owner	B-A
	O
has	O
always	O
been	O
accomodating	O
and	O
friendly.	O

The	O
waiters	B-A
	O
and	O
owners	B-A
	O
were	O
nonchalant	O
about	O
this	O
and	O
promised	O
to	O
call	O

weren't	O
as	O

live	O

when	O

I	O
ate	O
there	O
a	O

And	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
fantastic.	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
kind	O
of	O
place	O
you'd	O
like	O
to	O
take	O
all	O
your	O

to	O

If	O
you're	O

While	O
the	O

once	O
you're	O

you'll	O

what's	O

I've	O
lived	O
in	O

had	O
never	O

so	O
many	O

in	O
one	O

(except	O
in	O
a	O
really	O

Winnie	O

are	O
the	O

	O
you	O
can	O
find	O

The	O
ambiance	B-A
	O

minimal	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
not	O
phenomenal,	O
but	O
some	O
dishes	B-A
	O
are	O
quite	O
good,	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
eggplant	B-A

in	I-A

My	O

asked	O
for	O

	O
for	O
the	O

and	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
	O
gave	O
us	O
not	O
only	O
what	O
we	O
ordered,	O
but	O
some	O
other	O

that	O
were	O

You	O
can	O
even	O
get	O

Slightly	O
on	O

worth	O
it!	O

If	O
it	O
isn't	O
for	O
the	O

Our	O
last	O
time	O
there	O
a	O
few	O
weeks	O
ago	O
was	O
early	O
at	O
5pm	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
crowded	O
and	O
noisy.	O

Pick	O
a	O
bagel	O
has	O
the	O
best	O
bagels	B-A
	O
in	O
the	O
city.	O

You	O
are	O
paying	O
for	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
,	O
which	O
is	O
nice,	O
but	O
can	O
be	O
had	O
in	O
numerous	O
places	O
in	O
Bay	O
Ridge.	O

It's	O
called	O
Gnochi	O
alla	O
nona	O
and	O
is	O
found	O
under	O
Chef	O
Specials.	O

It	O
is	O
one	O
the	O
nicest	O
outdoor	O
restaurants	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
seen	O
in	O
NY--I	O
am	O
from	O
Italy	O
and	O
this	O
place	O
rivals	O
the	O
ones	O
in	O
my	O
country.	O

Yes	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
wait	B-A
	O
to	O
be	O
seated	O
and	O
because	O
its	O
small	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
waiting	B-A
area	I-A
	O
and	O
the	O
seat	B-A
	O
at	O
the	O
bar	B-A
	O
was	O
all	O
taken.	O

The	O
last	O
two	O
times	O
I	O
ordered	O
from	O
here	O
my	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
soo	O
spicy	O
that	O
	O
I	O
could	O
barely	O
eat	O
it,	O
and	O
the	O
spice	B-A
	O
took	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
flavor	B-A
	O
of	O
the	O
dish	B-A
.	O

The	O
fried	B-A
dumplings	I-A
	O
are	O
GREAT!	O

This	O
place	O
has	O
the	O
best	O
Chinese	O
style	O
BBQ	B-A
ribs	I-A
	O
in	O
the	O
city.	O

Ive	O
been	O
here	O
so	O
many	O
times	O
the	O
waiters	B-A
	O
know	O
my	O
name.	O

The	O
decor	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
simple	O
but	O
comfortable.	O

I've	O
been	O
frequenting	O
The	O
Tasting	O
Room	O
since	O
it	O
first	O
arrived	O
in	O
the	O
East	O
Village	O
and	O
I've	O
never	O
been	O
disappointed.	O

We	O
figured	O
we	O
never	O
had	O
Argentinian	B-A
Pizza	I-A
	O
before	O
so	O
we	O
grabbed	O
our	O
lunch	B-A
	O
there,	O
sharing	O
a	O
large	O
Pelligrino	B-A
,	O
a	O
pizza	B-A
	O
of	O
two	O
of	O
their	O
specials,	O
one	O
was	O
goat	B-A
cheese	I-A
	O
the	O
other	O
blue	B-A
cheese	I-A
,	O
and	O
both	O
were	O
excellent.	O

Heartland	O
Brewery	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
to	O
start	O
or	O
finish	O
your	O
day.	O

The	O
'kamasutra	B-A
'	O
and	O
'bombay	B-A
cosmopolitan	I-A
'	O
are	O
excellent	O
and	O
will	O
have	O
you	O
tipsy	O
in	O
no	O
time.	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
perfect	O
date	B-A
spot	I-A
	O
for	O
Williamsburg	O
couples.	O

The	O
dim	B-A
sum	I-A
	O
here	O
is	O
only	O
so-so.	O

It	O
was	O
raining,	O
and	O
we	O
figured	O
why	O
not?	O

$6	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
much	O
tasty	O
food	B-A
,	O
all	O
of	O
it	O
fresh	O
and	O
continually	O
refilled.	O

Just	O
straight	O
up	O
cheap,	O
good	O
food	B-A
.	O

Another	O
welcome	O
addition	O
to	O
the	O
neighborhood.	O

Seating	B-A
	O
is	O
ok	O
even	O
though	O
sometimes	O
there's	O
alot	O
of	O
people.	O

This	O
time,	O
I	O
prefer	O
not	O
to	O
go	O
into	O
detail.	O

Even	O
with	O
a	O
relatively	O
inexpensive	O
botle	B-A
of	I-A
wine	I-A
,	O
if	O
you	O
can	O
call	O
$70.00	O
inexpensive,	O
the	O
cost	B-A
	O
is	O
through	O
the	O
roof	O
for	O
better	O
than	O
average	O
fare.	O

Service	B-A
	O
was	O
slow,	O
but	O
the	O
people	B-A
	O
were	O
friendly.	O

Steamed	O
fresh	O
so	O
brought	O
hot	O
hot	O
hot	O
to	O
your	O
table.	O

The	O
steak	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
fatty	O
and	O
the	O
sauce	B-A
	O
was	O
overpowering	O
and	O
not	O
very	O
tasty.	O

My	O
only	O
problem	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
are	O
literally	O
sitting	O
on	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
next	O
to	O
you!	O

And	O
affordable.	O

The	O
staff	B-A
	O
makes	O
you	O
feel	O
at	O
home,	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
great	O
and	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
is	O
WONDERFUL!	O

i	O
actually	O
feel	O
like	O
i	O
should	O
keep	O
it	O
a	O
secret.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
alright	O
-	O
some	O
stuff	O
is	O
good	O
-	O
some	O
is	O
not	O
(like	O
the	O
steak	B-A
dish	I-A
	O
which	O
tends	O
to	O
be	O
dry).	O

Not	O
only	O
would	O
I	O
not	O
recommend	O
Jimmy's	O
restaurants	O
to	O
friends,	O
I	O
would	O
strongly	O
suggest	O
they	O
go	O
anywhere	O
but.	O

They	O
have	O
a	O
very	O
diverse	O
menu	B-A
	O
so	O
its	O
something	O
for	O
everybody.	O

Haru	O
on	O
Park	O
S	O
is	O
simply	O
disgusting.	O

The	O
staff	B-A
	O
was	O
too	O
busy	O
ordering	O
sushi	B-A
	O
for	O
dinner	B-A
	O
and	O
then	O
laying	O
it	O
out	O
to	O
eat	O
on	O
the	O
bar	B-A
	O
to	O
even	O
bring	O
me	O
my	O
check	B-A
.	O

As	O
a	O
long-time	O
patron	O
of	O
Mamoun's,	O
I	O
always	O
figured	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
found	O
the	O
best	O
late	O
night	O
food	B-A
spot	I-A
	O
in	O
the	O
city.	O

I	O
drop	O
more	O
dollar	O
bills	O
here	O
than	O
your	O
uncle	O
after	O
a	O
weekend	O
at	O
Scores.	O

The	O
bagel	B-A
	O
was	O
huge.	O

Go	O
there	O
to	O
relax	O
and	O
feel	O
like	O
your	O
somewhere	O
else.	O

Get	O
the	O
tuna	B-A
	O
of	O
gari.	O

I	O
like	O
the	O
somosas	B-A
,	O
chai	B-A
,	O
and	O
the	O
chole	B-A
,	O
but	O
the	O
dhosas	B-A
	O
and	O
dhal	B-A
	O
were	O
kinda	O
dissapointing.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
nice	O
surprise.	O

Edible	O
but	O
really	O
a	O
ripoff	O
at	O
those	O
prices	B-A
	O
given	O
whats	O
in	O
the	O
area.	O

The	O
staff	B-A
	O
has	O
been	O
nice,	O
but	O
they	O
seemed	O
really	O
stressed	O
and	O
the	O
unisex	O
bathroom	B-A
	O
needs	O
to	O
be	O
cleaned	O
more	O
often.	O

I	O
am	O
French	O
and	O
I	O
really	O
felt	O
like	O
home!!!	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
to	O
Casimir	O
over	O
5	O
times	O
and	O
I	O
have	O
always	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
time	O
there.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
good	O
about	O
this	O
restaurant.	O

It's	O
usually	O
packed	O
for	O
good	O
reason,	O
esp.	O

Service	B-A
-	O
friendly	O
and	O
attentive.	O

I	O
love	O
going	O
there!	O

I	O
cannot	O
recommend	O
OG	O
more	O
highly	O
if	O
I	O
tried	O
-	O
check	O
it	O
out	O
for	O
yourself.	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
we	O
ate	O
on	O
our	O
first	O
trip	O
to	O
New	O
York,	O
and	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
the	O
last	O
place	O
we	O
stop	O
as	O
we	O
head	O
out	O
of	O
town	O
on	O
our	O
next	O
trip	O
to	O
New	O
York.	O

Service	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
prompt	O
but	O
slightly	O
rushed.	O

Great	O
food	B-A
,	O
great	O

.	O

And,	O
atlhough	O
tables	B-A
	O
opened	O
up	O

to	O
us	O
and	O
we	O
ASKED	O
for	O
a	O
slightly	O
larger	O
space	B-A
,	O
they	O
left	O
us	O
awkardly	O
seated.	O

The	O
palak	B-A
paneer	I-A
	O
was	O
standard,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
fan	O
of	O
the	O
malai	B-A
kofta	I-A
.	O

I've	O
dined	O
at	O
Alain	O
Ducasse's	O
restaurant	O
in	O
Monte	O
Carlo	O
for	O
half	O
the	O
price	B-A
	O
for	O
the	O
same	O
excellent	O
dining	B-A
	O
experience.	O

Yeah,	O
sometimes	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
can	O
be	O
slow.	O

There	O
was	O
no	O
ambiance	B-A
.	O

Save	O
your	O
money	O
and	O
don't	O
waste	O
your	O
calories,	O
go	O
to	O
Margharita's	O
on	O
Washington	O
Street	O
instead,	O
they	O
have	O
amazing	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
BEST	O
service	B-A
.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
attentive	O
without	O
being	O
overbearing	O
and	O
each	O
dish	B-A
	O
we	O
tried	O
was	O
wonderful	O
from	O
the	O
spring	B-A
rolls	I-A
	O
to	O
the	O
cod	B-A
with	I-A
pineapple	I-A
tempura	I-A
.	O

But	O
trust	O
me	O
it	O
is	O
so	O
worth	O
it.	O

It	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
place	O
for	O
tourists	O
or	O
someone	O
who	O
has	O
never	O
dined	O
in	O
Bay	O
Ridge.	O

THe	O
perfect	O
spot.	O

The	O
only	O
weird	O
thing	O
was	O
if	O
we	O
got	O
a	O
bottle	B-A
,	O
the	O
waitress	B-A
	O
would	O
have	O
simply	O
multiplied	O
the	O
glass	O
price	B-A
	O
X4,	O
which	O
makes	O
no	O
sense	O
whatsoever.	O

They	O
sell	O
special	O
sushi	B-A
,	O
everything	O
have	O
a	O
topping	B-A
,	O
sauce	B-A
	O
and	O
etc.	O

DO	O
not	O
try	O
unless	O
you're	O
just	O
going	O
there	O
to	O
hang	O
out	O
like	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
hipsters	O
who	O
apparently	O
have	O
no	O
sense	O
of	O
taste	B-A
.	O

They	O
never	O
came	O
back	O
to	O
refill	O
our	O
glasses	O
again.	O

The	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
small	O
and	O
intimate	O
and	O
you	O
may	O
feel	O
a	O
little	O
crowded,	O
but	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
excellent	O
and	O
it's	O
great	O
for	O
friends	O
out,	O
a	O

The	O

Service	B-A
	O

I	O
took	O
my	O

her	O
birthday	O
last	O
night	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
relaxing,	O
really	O
good	O
meal	B-A
.	O

I	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
so	O
disappointed	O
with	O
the	O
portions	B-A
	O
if	O
the	O
qualities	B-A
	O
were	O
good	O
enough	O
to	O
make	O
up	O
for	O
it,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
not!	O

They're	O
rude	O
at	O
times,	O
and	O
not	O
very	O
friendly.	O

I'm	O
happy	O
to	O

the	O
wait	B-A
service	I-A
	O
has	O
always	O
been	O
sub-par	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
goes	O
from	O
nice	O
to	O
really	O
irritating	O
(if	O
you	O
sit	O
in	O
the	O

	O

the	O
acousitcs	O

me	O
of	O

The	O

	O
seemed	O

fresh	O
and	O
was	O

moral	O
stay	O
away.	O

but	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
a	O
bit	O
slow.	O

Spreads	B-A
	O
and	O
toppings	B-A
	O
are	O
great	O
-	O
though	O
a	O

pricey.	O

When	O
I	O
saw	O
that	O
their	O

I	O

No	O

what	O

with	O
nothing	O
touched	O
on	O
our	O

Indoor	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
cozy	O
and	O
cute.	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
3	O
hour	O
brunch	B-A
-	O
they	O
definitely	O
do	O
not	O
rush	O
you-	O
and	O
they	O
kept	O
the	O
unlimited	O
mimosas	B-A
	O
flowing	O
the	O
whole	O
time.	O

And	O
their	O
prices	B-A
	O
are	O
very	O
high	O
-	O
they	O
actually	O
think	O
that	O
they	O
can	O
get	O
away	O
with	O
charging	O
such	O
prices	B-A
	O
for	O
such	O
terrible	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
service	B-A
!	O

They're	O
terrific!!	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
excellent,	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
excellent,	O
but	O
the	O
entire	O
experience	O
was	O
very	O
cool.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
good	O
and	O
the	O

Great	O

whether	O

Just	O
stick	O
with	O
the	O
small	O

!	O

The	O
cafe	B-A
	O
itself	O
was	O
really	O
nice	O
with	O
comfortable	O
outdoor	B-A
chairs	I-A
	O
and	O
tables	B-A
,	O
but	O
the	O

could	O

been	O
better.	O

I've	O
rarely	O
had	O
a	O
problem	O
with	O
slow	O
staff	B-A
	O
in	O
the	O
10	O
years	O
I've	O
been	O
going.	O

Food	B-A
	O
is	O
excellent.	O

This	O

is	O
a	O
literal	O
hole-in-the-wall	O

within	O
Doyers,	O
right	O
off	O

They	O
outshine	O

Although	O
we	O
were	O
looking	O
for	O

lettuce	B-A
	O
and	O
some	O
walnuts	B-A
	O
the	O
salads	B-A
	O
we	O
got	O
were	O
great.	O

Excellent	O
lunch	B-A
buffet	I-A
	O
for	O
only	O
$6.95.	O

We	O
were	O
sorry	O
to	O
check	O
them	O
off	O
our	O
list	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
enjoyed	O
and	O
recommended	O
the	O
place	O
in	O
the	O
past.	O

If	O
you're	O
not	O
familiar	O
with	O
the	O
cuisine	B-A
,	O
you	O
may	O
encounter	O
problems	O
ordering	O
here	O
and	O
be	O
sure	O
to	O
bring	O
plenty	O
of	O
cash	O
with	O
you	O
as	O
they	O
don't	O
accept	O
credit	O
cards.	O

both	O
are	O
very	O
reasonably	O
priced	B-A
	O
(around	O
$8	O
for	O
dinner	B-A
	O
and	O
$5	O
for	O
lunch	B-A
),	O
and	O
are	O
delicious	O
and	O
filling.	O

Problem	O
is	O
nothing	O
at	O
Prune	O
is	O
particularly	O
memorable.	O

Ambience	B-A
	O
is	O
so	O
cute	O
and	O
quaint,	O
good	O
for	O
business	O
although	O
we	O
were	O
there	O
on	O
vacation.	O

The	O
portion	B-A
sizes	I-A
	O
here	O
are	O
huge,	O
and	O
the	O
sushi	B-A
	O
is	O
good.	O

Just	O
wish	O
they'd	O
expand.	O

My	O
boyfriend	O
ate	O
tuna	B-A
	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
cooked	O
perfectly!	O

This	O
wasn't	O
the	O
expected	O
menu	B-A
	O
comprised	O
only	O
of	O
pad	B-A
thai	I-A
	O
and	O
tom	B-A
yum	I-A
soup	I-A
,	O
but	O
I	O
thought	O
that	O
was	O
what	O
made	O
the	O
place	O
so	O
special.	O

Good	O
food	B-A
	O
at	O
the	O
restaurant	O
(a	O
bit	O
expensive,	O
but	O
great	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
impress	O
your	O
date).	O

I	O
highly	O
recommend	O
Caviar	O
Russe	O
to	O
anyone	O
who	O
wants	O
delicious	O
top	O
grade	O
caviar	B-A
	O
and	O
fantastic	O
service	B-A
.	O

You	O
can't	O
say	O
its	O
cheap	O
because	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
cheaper	O
in	O
Chinatown.	O

I	O
have	O
eaten	O
there	O
3-4	O
times	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
always	O
good.	O

keep	O
up	O
the	O
good	O
work.	O

I	O
wasn't	O
thrilled	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
wait	B-A
	O
on	O
line	O
for	O
thirty	O
minutes,	O
but	O
I	O
guess	O
that's	O
the	O
price	O
you	O
pay	O
for	O
a	O
popular	O
place.	O

great	O
eats	B-A
,	O
good	O
times.	O

Make	O
sure	O
you	O
try	O
this	O
place	O
as	O
often	O
as	O
you	O
can.	O

Grilled	O
whole	O
fish	B-A
	O
wonderful,	O
great	O
spicing.	O

For	O
years,	O
I	O
thought	O
Tuscan	B-A
cuisine	I-A
	O
was	O
the	O
best,	O
but	O
Salvatore	O
converted	O
me	O
to	O
the	O
hearty	O
Neapolitan	B-A
fare	I-A
	O
on	O
my	O
first	O
visit.	O

Plus,	O
when	O
our	O
entrees	B-A
	O
were	O
held	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
kitchen	O
on	O
a	O
busy	O
Saturday	O
night,	O
the	O
owner	B-A
	O
sent	O
over	O
complimentary	O
summer	B-A
rolls	I-A
	O
to	O
hold	O
us	O
over!	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
great	O
as	O
well.	O

Try	O
the	O
lobster	B-A
teriyaki	I-A
	O
and	O
the	O
rose	B-A
special	I-A
roll	I-A
.	O

Another	O
plus	O
is	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
entrees	B-A
	O
are	O
approx.	O

I	O
will	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
Suan	O
soon!	O

Loved	O
it!	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
delicious,	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
was	O
relaxed,	O
and	O
we	O
have	O
now	O
adopted	O
Plate	O
347	O
as	O
our	O
Secret	O
on	O
Second!	O

We	O
were	O
pleasantly	O
surprised.	O

From	O
the	O
moment	O
we	O
walked	O
in	O
they	O
were	O
more	O
than	O
accomodating	O
even	O
though	O
the	O
place	B-A
	O
was	O
packed.	O

It	O
is	O
LOUD,	O
HOT	O
and	O
DARK.	O

I	O
found	O
the	O
food	B-A
,	O
service	B-A
	O
and	O
value	B-A
	O
exceptional	O
everytime	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
there.	O

We	O
ate	O
at	O
this	O
Thai	O
place	O
following	O
the	O
reviews	O
but	O
very	O
unhappy	O
with	O
the	O
foods	B-A
.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
definitely	O
good,	O
but	O
I	O
left	O
a	O
bit	O
disappointed.	O

I	O
am	O
a	O
100	O
lb	O
girl,	O
had	O
a	O
glass	B-A
of	I-A
wine	I-A
	O
and	O
a	O
glass	B-A
of	I-A
beer	I-A
	O
prior	O
to	O
the	O
dinner	B-A
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
still	O
HUNGRY	O
after	O
my	O
visit	O
to	O
this	O
place!	O

The	O
drinks	B-A
	O
are	O
a	O
saving	O
grace,	O
but	O
service	B-A
staff	I-A
,	O
please,	O
get	O
over	O
yourselves.	O

It	O
was	O
wonderful.	O

There	O
is	O
a	O
downside	O
if	O
you're	O
ordering	O
in	O
--	O
the	O
delivery	B-A
guys	I-A
	O
have	O
MAJOR	O
attitude.	O

Will	O
give	O
it	O
another	O
chance	O
before	O
I	O
write	O
it	O
off.	O

The	O
all-Italian	O
staff	B-A
	O
is	O
warm	O
and	O
engaging	O
from	O
the	O
start.	O

Village	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
places	O
that	O
scores	O
on	O
all	O
fronts.	O

The	O
prices	B-A
	O
are	O
exceptionally	O
reasonable	O
for	O
food	B-A
	O
of	O
this	O
caliber.	O

If	O
you	O
go	O
here	O
-	O
your	O
focus	O
should	O
be	O
the	O
Tamarind	B-A
Margaritas	I-A
.	O

It	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
hidden	O
spot	O
there	O
and	O
I	O
rave	O
about	O
it	O
to	O
everyone.	O

The	O
filet	B-A
mignon	I-A
dish	I-A
	O
was	O
superb!	O

I	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
regular	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
consistently	O
good	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
ease	O
of	O
getting	B-A
a	I-A
table	I-A
.	O

Can't	O
wait	O
wait	O
for	O
my	O
next	O
visit.	O

This	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
Japanese	O
it	O
can	O
ever	O
get.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
good,	O
I	O
can't	O
lie.	O

great	O
food	B-A
,	O
lt's	O
of	O
it,	O
more	O
then	O
one	O
person	O
can	O
eat!	O

I	O
didn't	O
expect	O
to	O
like	O
Nosh	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
I	O
did,	O
but	O
the	O
pastrami	B-A
on	I-A
challah	I-A
sandwich	I-A
	O
I	O
had	O
was	O
otherworldly,	O
the	O
soups	B-A
	O
are	O
like	O
Mom's,	O
and	O
the	O
knishes	B-A
	O
give	O
Yonah	O
Schimmel's	O
a	O
run	O
for	O
its	O
money.	O

The	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
is	O
nothing	O
special,	O
but	O
it	O
feels	O
like	O
a	O
Sushi	O
establishment	O
in	O
Tokyo.	O

Cozy	O
romantic	O
atomosphere	B-A
	O
with	O
only	O
around	O
15	O
tables	B-A
	O
at	O
most.	O

This	O
place	O
is	O
worth	O
going	O
even	O
if	O
only	O
for	O
their	O
beer	B-A
.	O

I	O
really	O
like	O
both	O
the	O
scallops	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
mahi	B-A
mahi	I-A
(on	I-A
saffron	I-A
risotto	I-A
-yum!).	O

The	O
ambience	B-A
	O
was	O
so	O
fun,	O
and	O
the	O
prices	B-A
	O
were	O
great,	O
on	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
really	O
tasty.	O

Do	O

what	O

a	O

	O
though.	O

Stay	O
away	O
from	O
this	O
place.	O

Good,	O
because	O
hey,	O
it's	O
more	O
food	B-A
,	O
but	O
bad	O
because	O
dim	B-A
sum	I-A
	O
is	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
smaller	O

	O
so	O
you	O
can	O
try	O
out	O
more	O

	O
and	O
smaller	O
so	O
that	O
each	O

	O
is	O
cheap.	O

Even	O
if	O
the	O
food	B-A

wasn't	O
this	O
good,	O
the	O

is	O
a	O
great	O
place	B-A
	O
to	O
sit	O

the	O

you	O

that	O

the	O

The	O

the	O

the	O

of	O
the	O

The	O
chicken	B-A
	O

	O
were	O
seasoned	O

cooked	O
to	O

and	O
the	O

We	O

I'm	O
not	O
sure	O
which	O

	O
it	O
was.	O

No	O
you're	O
going	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
because	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
good.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
great	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
even	O
better.	O

While	O
this	O
can	O
hardly	O
be	O
called	O
a	O
restaurant,	O
it	O
is	O
possibly	O
the	O
best	O
deal	O
in	O
Manhatten:	O
$4	O
for	O
a	O

Traditional	B-A
French	I-A
decour	I-A
	O
was	O
pleasant	O
though	O
the	O
hall	B-A
	O
was	O
rather	O
noisy	O
-	O
the	O
restaurant	O
was	O
full	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
raise	O
our	O
voices	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
maintain	O
a	O
conversation.	O

The	O
fish	B-A
	O
is	O
fresh	O
and	O
each	O
piece	O
is	O
sliced	O
to	O
perfection	O
and	O
seasoned	O
by	O
the	O

chef	I-A
	O
(usually	O
with	O
a	O
little	O
fresh	O
wasabi	B-A
	O
and	O
soy	B-A

	O
but	O
also	O
sometimes	O
with	O
some	O

).	O

Consequently,	O
their	O
burgers	B-A
	O
fell	O
apart	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O
and	O
made	O
such	O
a	O
mess	O
that	O
they	O
did'nt	O
feel	O
like	O
finishing	O
them.	O

My	O
son	O
and	O
his	O
girlfriend	O
both	O
wanted	O
cheeseburgers	B-A
	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
huge!	O

I	O
really	O
recommend	O
the	O
very	O

I	O
will	O

Unbelievable.	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
Thai	O

I	O
go	O
too	O
in	O
NYC,	O
it's	O
wonderful,	O
and	O
live	O
relaxed	O
Jazz	B-A
	O
on	O
certain	O

We	O
will	O
be	O
back.	O

We	O
were	O
seated	O
and	O
ignored	O
by	O
waitstaff	B-A
.	O

If	O
you	O
are	O
in	O
a	O
big	O
group,	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
perfect	O
because	O
it	O
recomends	O
sharing	O
-	O
they	O
have	O
lazy	B-A
susans	I-A
	O
on	O
most	O
tables	B-A
	O
-	O
even	O
families	O
can	O
feel	O
comfortable	O
here.	O

They	O
showed	O
up	O
15	O
minutes	O
after	O
the	O

Tasty	O

,	O
the	O

I	O
went	O
with	O
5	O
friends	O
and	O
we	O
lingered	O
at	O
the	O
table	B-A
	O
for	O
a	O
bit	O
and	O
didn't	O
feel	O
rushed	O
at	O
all	O
even	O
though	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
wait	B-A
.	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
Ruby	O
Foos	O
for	O
my	O
birthday	O
and	O
enjoyed	O
our	O
experience	O
there.	O

I'd	O
highly	O
recommend	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
special	O
occasion	O
--	O
it	O
provides	O
and	O
intimate	O
setting	B-A
	O
and	O
nice	O
service	B-A
.	O

The	O
burger	B-A
	O
was	O
great,	O
also.	O

they	O
did	O
give	O
a	O
15%	O
discount	B-A
	O
at	O
the	O
end,	O
wasn't	O
enough,	O
as	O
they	O
knew	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
horrible.	O

Just	O
because	O
it's	O
cheap	O
does	O
NOT	O
mean	O
the	O
portions	B-A
	O
are	O
small	O
or	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
nasty,	O
IT	O
IS	O
GREAT!	O

The	O
pizza	B-A
	O
was	O
great.	O

And	O
everytime	O
I	O
go	O
there's	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
drunk	O
idiots	O
making	O
a	O
scene	O
out	O
front.	O

I	O
had	O
never	O
had	O
Edamame	B-A
pureed	I-A
	O
before	O
but	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
innovative	O
and	O
tasty	O
(could've	O
used	O
a	O
bit	O
more	O
salt).	O

however,	O
it's	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
that	O
leaves	O
a	O
bad	O
taste	O
in	O
my	O
mouth.	O

When	O
we	O
notified	O
him	O
that	O
he	O
didn't	O
mention	O
the	O
specials	B-A
,	O
he	O
didn't	O
apologize	O
but	O
let	O
us	O
know	O
that	O
we	O
made	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
decision	O
regardless.	O

The	O
price	B-A
	O
was	O
extremely	O
reasonable	O
for	O
the	O
appetizers	B-A
	O
and	O
food	B-A
	O
we	O
ate.	O

Don't	O
dine	O
at	O
Tamarind	O
for	O
the	O
vegetarian	B-A
dishes	I-A
,	O
they	O
are	O
simply	O
not	O
up	O
to	O
par	O
with	O
the	O
non-veg	B-A
selections	I-A
.	O

Kenny	O
the	O
owner	B-A
	O
is	O
always	O
there	O
and	O
he	O
treats	O
my	O
family	O
like	O
we	O
are	O
part	O
of	O
his	O
family.	O

They	O
need	O
a	O
kick	O
out	O
of	O
it	O
but	O
until	O
then	O
the	O
sushi	B-A
	O
is	O
pretty	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
consistent.	O

I've	O
had	O
to	O
wait	O
only	O
a	O
few	O
times	O
during	O
lunch	B-A
	O
but	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
definitely	O
worth	O
the	O
wait	B-A
.	O

All	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
above	O
average	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
return	O
to	O
see	O
how	O
they	O
operate	O
with	O
four	O
or	O
less	O
dinners	B-A
.	O

Judging	O
from	O
previous	O
posts	O
this	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
good	O
place,	O
but	O
not	O
any	O
longer.	O

Delicious	O
food	B-A
,	O
excellent	O
service	B-A
,	O
and	O
a	O
pretty	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
make	O
this	O
a	O
great	O
choice	O
for	O
dinner	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
$5.99	O
lunch	B-A
buffet	I-A
	O
makes	O
it	O
an	O
even	O
better	O
choice	O
for	O
lunch	B-A
!	O

For	O
appetizers	B-A
,	O
I	O
recommend	O
the	O
shrimp	B-A
fritters	I-A
	O
and	O
dumplings	B-A
.	O

And	O
cheap!	O

Such	O
nice	O
people	B-A
	O
working	O
here	O
-	O
but	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
review	O
the	O
food	B-A
.	O

The	O
restaurant	O
is	O
dark	O
and	O
not	O
very	O
attractive	O
and	O
then	O
you	O
have	O
spot	B-A
lights	I-A
	O
shining	O
on	O
you	O
putting	O
you	O
in	O
the	O
worst	O
light	O
possible,	O
reaching	O
for	O
sunglasses.	O

Nice	O

Veal	B-A

Better	O
than	O
Patsy's!	O

Great	O
wine	B-A
,	O
great	O
food	B-A
.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
mediocre,	O
and	O
the	O
lack	O
of	O
air	B-A
conditioning	I-A
	O
made	O
for	O
a	O
less	O
than	O
comfortable	O
meal	B-A
.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
staff	B-A
	O
always	O
surprise	O
me	O
with	O
the	O
new	O
heights	O
they	O
are	O
taken	O
to.	O

Amazing!	O

Went	O
to	O
Ottimo	O
and	O
was	O
expecting	O
outstanding	O
pizza	B-A
	O
(as	O
I	O
love	O
La	O
Pizza	O
Fresca).	O

I've	O
always	O
been	O
seated	O
propmtly.	O

We	O
try	O
frequenting	O
new	O
restaurants	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
city,	O
but	O
any	O
time	O
that	O
we	O
visit	O
a	O
restaurant	O
other	O
than	O
Roth's	O
we	O
are	O
always	O
disappointed.	O

honestly	O
the	O
worst	O
sushi	B-A
	O
my	O
husband	O
and	O
i	O
had	O
in	O
our	O
entire	O
lives.	O

There	O
is	O
nothing	O
more	O
pleasant	O
than	O
that.	O

I	O
would	O
recommend	O
this	O
place	O
to	O
anyone	O
and	O
would	O
without	O
a	O
doubt	O
come	O
again.	O

However,	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
great	O
food	B-A
	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
price	B-A
	O
and	O
don't	O
mind	O
the	O
decor	B-A
,	O
you	O
can't	O
beat	O
this	O
place.	O

What	O
makes	O
this	O
restaurant	O
special	O
are	O
the	O
authentic	O
sichuan	B-A
cooking	I-A
	O
and	O
being	O
the	O
only	O
one	O
in	O

Mizu	O

For	O
sure	O
i	O
will	O
keep	O
coming	O
back	O
because	O
i	O
feel	O
really	O
this	O
restaurant	O
deserves.	O

tiny	O

	O
for	O
two	O

One	O
of	O
my	O

in	O
the	O

Lobster	I-A
,	O
a	O
cold	B-A
lobster	I-A

	O
that	O
was	O
magnificent.	O

I	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
I	O
am	O
pleasantly	O
suprised	O
and	O
I	O
will	O
most	O
likely	O
stop	O
in	O
again	O
if	O
I	O
am	O
in	O
the	O
neighborhood.	O

Ask	O
for	O
Usha,	O
the	O
nicest	O
bartender	B-A
	O
in	O
manhattan.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
outstanding	O
and	O
my	O
crab-cake	B-A
eggs	I-A
benedict	I-A
	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
better.	O

The	O
place's	O
decor	B-A
	O
and	O
hidden	O
bathrooms	B-A
	O
made	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
laugh.	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
true	O
gem	O
of	O
the	O
village.	O

Its	O
location	B-A
	O
is	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
Hutner	O
College	O
is	O
near	O
and	O
their	O
prices	B-A
	O
are	O
very	O
reasonable,	O
makes	O
students	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
Suan	O
again	O
and	O
again.	O

However,	O
I	O
think	O
Jeckll	O
and	O
Hydes	O
t	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
places	O
that	O
is	O
fun	O
to	O
do	O
once.	O

They	O
treat	O
me	O
like	O
family,	O
morning	O
and	O
night.	O

A	O
wonderful	O
place	B-A
!	O

Please	O
take	O
my	O
advice,	O
go	O
and	O
try	O
this	O
place.	O

Service	B-A
	O
was	O
on	O
par	O
but	O
not	O
wonderful.	O

for	O
my	O
birthday	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
an	O
excellent	O
time.	O

Deliveries	B-A
	O
often	O
take	O
up	O
to	O
an	O
hour	O
and	O
the	O
prices	B-A
	O
are	O
higher	O
than	O
most	O
other	O
pizzerias	O
in	O
the	O
area.	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
Amma	O
after	O
a	O
friend	O
recommended	O
it.	O

I'm	O
just	O
reading	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
reviews	O
and	O
its	O
nonsense	O
that	O
people	O
are	O
reviewing	O
some	O
places	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
loud.	O

Kind	O
of	O
a	O
small	O
place	B-A
	O
but	O
I	O
guess	O
if	O
they	O
are	O
not	O
too	O
busy	O
might	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
fit	O
a	O
group	O
or	O
kids.	O

Maybe	O
tomorrow	O
;-)	O

We	O
also	O
ordered	O
two	O
hot	B-A
dogs	I-A
	O
thinking	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
pretty	O
good	O
since	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
whole	O
section	O
on	O
the	O
menu	B-A
	O
devoted	O
to	O
them.	O

please	O
don't	O
fool	O
us.	O

I've	O
had	O
the	O
chicken	B-A
with	I-A
garlic	I-A
sauce	I-A
,	O
chicken	B-A
with	I-A
black	I-A
bean	I-A

Because	O
of	O
the	O
delicate	O
thin	O
crust	B-A
,	O
take-out	B-A
pies	I-A
	O
get	O
soggy	O
in	O
their	O
boxes.	O

I	O
suspect	O
this	O
restaurant	O
is	O
what	O
Rao's	O
would	O
be	O
if	O
it	O
hadn't	O
turned	O
exclusive.	O

The	O
dish	B-A
	O
had	O
like	O
6	O
pieces	O
of	O

	O
in	O
it.	O

strike	O
up	O
a	O

you,	O
or	O
with	O
the	O

We	O
were	O
then	O
shooed	O
inside.	O

We	O
got	O
in	O

and	O
were	O
served	B-A
	O
while	O
in	O
line	O
a	O
bannan	B-A
fritter	I-A

It	O
might	O
have	O

a	O
little	O

for	O
my	O

which	O
you	O

with	O
eat	O
more	O

	O
and	O

This	O

My	O

I	O

I	O
don't	O
know	O
about	O
you	O
guys,	O
but	O
when	O
I	O
go	O
somewhere	O
to	O
eat	O
I	O
go	O
for	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
not	O
for	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
.	O

They	O
should	O
have	O
called	O
it	O
mascarpone	B-A
with	I-A
chocolate	I-A
chip	I-A
s-good	O
but	O
a	O
far	O
cry	O
from	O
what	O
the	O
name	O
implies.	O

A	O
gentleman,	O
maybe	O
the	O
manager	B-A
,	O
came	O
to	O
our	O
table	B-A
,	O
and	O
without	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
a	O
smile	O
or	O
greeting	O
asked	O
for	O
our	O
order.	O

Very	O
different	O
than	O
regular	O
dimsum	O
places.	O

I	O
have	O
lived	O
in	O
NY	O
for	O
many	O
years	O
and	O
have	O
dined	O
at	O
many	O
restaraunts.	O

When	O
you	O
enter,	O
you	O
feel	O
like	O
you	O
have	O
entered	O
your	O
mom's	O
kitchen.	O

we	O
were	O
tired	O
and	O
cold	O
when	O
we	O
got	O
to	O
the	O
restaurant,	O
then	O
we	O
sat	O
down	O
to	O
begin	O
ordering	O
appetizers	B-A
.	O

I've	O
had	O
pizza	B-A
	O
both	O
times	O
and	O
the	O
caprese	B-A
salad	I-A
appetizer	I-A
.	O

She	O
lives	O
nearby	O
but	O
had	O
never	O
gone	O
to	O
this	O
establishment	O
thinking	O
that	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
too	O
touristy.	O

He	O
was	O
terribly	O
thirsty	O
after	O
the	O
meal	B-A
	O
too.	O

And	O
when	O
I	O
visit	O
her	O
I	O
make	O
it	O
a	O
point	O
to	O
eat	O
at	O
'Ino	O
at	O
least	O
once	O
daily	O
if	O
not	O
once	O
for	O
the	O
whole	O
trip.	O

I	O
wasn't	O
there	O
for	O
the	O
Half-Price	B-A
Saturday	I-A
Night	I-A
Special	I-A
,	O
but	O
Tuesday	O
Night.	O

In	O
fact,	O
it	O
appears	O
he	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
go	O
postal	O
at	O
any	O
moment.	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
small	O
group	O
of	O
us	O
looking	O
somewhere	O
to	O
eat	O
kinda	O
late	O
on	O
a	O
weeknight	O
and	O
we	O
ended	O
up	O
at	O
Pastis.	O

for	O
Meetball	O
Night.	O

If	O
you	O
like	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
value	B-A
	O
you	O
get	O
from	O
some	O
of	O
Chinatown	O
restaurants,	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
place	O
for	O
you.	O

They	O
are	O
opening	O
two	O
more	O
places	O
as	O
i	O
saw	O
a	O
flyer	O
there	O
one	O
in	O
Yonkers	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
restraunt	O
and	O
banquet	O
hall	O
and	O
another	O
one	O
in	O
parsipanny	O
new	O
jersey.	O

Want	O
to	O
impress?	O

The	O
selection	B-A
	O
changes	O
frequently	O
but	O
the	O
basic	B-A
dishes	I-A
	O
are	O
always	O
available.	O

We've	O
lived	O
in	O
the	O
area	O
for	O
more	O
than	O
8	O
years.	O

Get	O
the	O
soup	B-A
	O
and	O
a	O
nosh	B-A
(pastrami	I-A
sandwich)	I-A
	O
for	O
$8	O
and	O
you're	O
golden.	O

I	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
if	O
this	O
what	O
makes	O
it	O
easier	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
saet	O
a	O
lunch	B-A
-	O
I	O
dont	O
mind.	O

My	O
family	O
and	O
I	O
ate	O
here	O
last	O
night	O
for	O
our	O
annual	O
Christmas	B-A
dinner	I-A
	O
with	O
the	O
family	O
members	O
who	O
would	O
rather	O
spend	O
the	O
holidays	O
with	O
friends	O
out-of-town.	O

I	O
grew	O
up	O
on	O
these	O
bagels	B-A
.	O

We	O
were	O
told	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
booked	O
solid	O
and	O
no	O
other	O
table	B-A
	O
was	O
available.	O

The	O
restaraurant	O
is	O
very	O
small	O
so	O
reservations	B-A
	O
are	O
a	O
must.	O

Visited	O
there	O
while	O
on	O
vacation	O
and	O
reading	O
the	O
reviews.	O

A	O
one	O
women	O
show!	O

You	O
can't	O
go	O
wrong	O
here.	O

At	O
first	O
i	O
was	O
rolling	O
my	O
ideas	O
of	O
yet	O
another	O
French	O
place	O
on	O
the	O
UES.	O

To	O
my	O
right,	O
the	O
hostess	B-A
	O
stood	O
over	O
a	O
busboy	B-A
	O
and	O
hissed	O
rapido,	O
rapido	O
as	O
he	O
tried	O
to	O
clear	O
and	O
re-set	O
a	O
table	B-A
	O
for	O
six.	O

In	O
China	O
the	O
phrase	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
restaurant	O
is	O
hot	O
and	O
loud.	O

After	O
dealing	O
with	O
subpar	O
pizza	B-A
	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
Kensington	O
neighborhood	O
-	O
I've	O
found	O
little	O
toninos.	O

I	O
thought	O
this	O
place	O
was	O
totally	O
overrated.	O

then	O
we	O
ordered	O
a	O
dinosaur	B-A
rolls	I-A
	O
and	O
white	B-A
tuna	I-A
sashimi	I-A
.	O

You	O
won't	O
find	O
that	O
anywhere	O
in	O
Manhattan.	O

How	O
do	O
you	O
rate	O
home?	O

I	O
went	O
here	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
with	O
a	O
friend.	O

Our	O
first	O
greeting	O
when	O
we	O
entered	O
was	O
The	O
last	O
call	O
is	O
at	O
10:15.	O

Interior	O
was	O
so	O
so.	O

I'm	O
partial	O
to	O
the	O
Gnocchi	B-A
.	O

I	O
guess	O
the	O
way	O
my	O
friends	O
and	O
I	O
described	O
it	O
was	O
The	O
French	O
Colonies.	O

they	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
squeeze	O
me	O
in	O
at	O
6	O
after	O
i	O
called	O
the	O
night	O
before	O
my	O
anniversary	O
for	O
a	O
friday	O
night	O
reservation	B-A
	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
they'd	O
treat	O
us	O
well	O
for	O
the	O
occasion.	O

Boy	O
was	O
I	O
wrong!	O

I	O
visit	O
New	O
Green	O
Bo	O
when	O
I	O
have	O
money	O
or	O
when	O
I	O
am	O
broke.	O

Note	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
serve	O
beer	B-A
,	O
you	O
must	O
bring	O
your	O
own.	O

We	O
ate	O
outside	O
at	O
Haru's	O
Sake	O
bar	B-A
	O
because	O
Haru's	O
restaurant	O
next	O
door	O
was	O
overflowing.	O

When	O
we	O
walked	O
in	O
it	O
seemed	O
like	O
it	O
was	O
there	O
for	O
200	O
years.	O

Ahhh...	O

Better	O
than	O
the	O
bagel	O
shop	O
on	O
the	O
corner,	O
but	O
not	O
worth	O
going	O
out	O
of	O
your	O
way	O
for,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion.	O

it	O
helps	O
if	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
to	O
order.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
typical	O
short-order,	O
dinner	O
type.	O

We	O
shared	O
a	O
bottle	B-A
of	I-A
sake	I-A
,	O
an	O
order	O
of	O
edamames	B-A
,	O
and	O
she	O
had	O
the	O
sushi	B-A
plate	I-A
	O
while	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
sashimi	B-A
.	O

I	O
can't	O
believe	O
people	O
complain	O
about	O
no	O
cheese	B-A
sticks	I-A
?	O

But	O
that	O
is	O
highly	O
forgivable.	O

From	O
the	O
appetizers	B-A
	O
we	O
ate,	O
the	O
dim	B-A
sum	I-A
	O
and	O
other	O
variety	O
of	O
foods	B-A
,	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O
criticize	O
the	O
food	B-A
.	O

When	O
we	O
arrived	O
at	O
6:00	O
PM,	O
the	O
restaurant	O
was	O
practically	O
empty.	O

Each	O
table	B-A
	O
has	O
a	O
pot	B-A
of	I-A
boiling	I-A
water	I-A
	O
sunken	O
into	O
its	O
surface,	O
and	O
you	O
get	O
platters	O
of	O
thin	O
sliced	O
meats	B-A
,	O
various	O
vegetables	B-A
,	O
and	O
rice	B-A
	O
and	O
glass	B-A
noodles	I-A

I	O
am	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
mid	O
