Did	O
I	O
mention	O
that	O
the	O
coffee	B-A
	O
is	O
OUTSTANDING?	O

Certainly	O
not	O
the	O
best	O
sushi	B-A
	O
in	O
New	O

however,	O
it	O
is	O
always	O
fresh,	O
and	O
the	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
clean,	O
sterile.	O

I	O
trust	O
the	O
people	B-A
	O
at	O
Go	O

and	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O

also	O
VERY	O
good.	O

In	O
fact,	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
Nicoise	B-A

	O
and	O
was	O
barely	O
eatable.	O

While	O
there's	O
a	O

it	O
shouldn't	O
take	O
ten	O

to	O

Great	O
food	B-A
	O
but	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
dreadful!	O

The	O
portions	B-A
of	I-A
the	I-A
food	I-A
	O
that	O
came	O
out	O
were	O
mediocre.	O

the	O
two	O

	O
looked	O
like	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
sucking	O
on	O

From	O
the	O

we	O

the	O

We	O

will	O
be	O
going	O
back	O
for	O
the	O

....	O

Desserts	B-A

my	O
personal	O
favorite	O
is	O
their	O
Tart	B-A
of	I-A
the	I-A
Day	I-A
.	O

I	O
am	O
surprised	O
at	O
the	O
lower	O

because	O
it	O
is	O
definitely	O
better	O
than	O
other	O
places	O
I	O
have	O
tried	O
with	O
higher	O
ratings.	O

Maybe	O
the	O
secret	O
was	O
that	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
a	O
Sunday	O
night	O
and	O
everything	O
was	O
great.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
extremely	O
tasty,	O
creatively	O
presented	O
and	O
the	O

	O
excellent.	O

WE	O
ENDED	O

food	B-A
	O
is	O
surprisingly	O
good,	O
and	O
the	O

How	O

that	O
it	O

Two	O

I	O
absolutely	O

this	O

think	O
the	O

Also,	O
the	O

Overall,	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
new	O
restaurant	O
that	O
has	O
been	O
consistently	O
good	O
every	O

in	O

My	O

for	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
we	O
have	O
lived	O
here,	O
Peasant	O
has	O
been	O
our	O
favorite!	O

The	O
whole	O
experience	O
was	O
satisfying.	O

However,	O
it	O
was	O
worth	O
the	O
visit.	O

The	O
menu	B-A
	O
is	O
interesting	O
and	O
quite	O
reasonably	O
priced	B-A
.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
delicious	O
and	O
clearly	O
fresh	O
ingredients	B-A
	O
were	O
used.	O

This	O
made	O
it	O
obvious	O
that	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
wasn't	O
cooked	O
fresh;	O
it	O
was	O
obviously	O
made	O
before	O
hand	O
and	O
then	O
reheated.	O

Appetizer	B-A
	O
are	O

here;	O
you	O
can	O
make	O
a	O
great	O
(and	O
inexpensive)	O

	O
out	O
of	O
them.	O

The	O

	O
are	O
a	O
highlight.	O

Also	O
get	O
the	O
Onion	B-A

	O
--	O
best	O
we've	O
ever	O
had.	O

Would	O
not	O
return	O
for	O
the	O
amount	O
we	O
paid.	O

However,	O
being	O
foodies,	O
we	O
were	O
utterly	O
disappointed	O
with	O
the	O
food	B-A
.	O

Huge	O
portions	B-A
,	O
great	O
and	O
attentive	O
service	B-A
,	O
and	O
pretty	O

I	O
was	O
highly	O
disappointed	O
by	O
their	O
service	B-A
	O
and	O
food	B-A
.	O

I	O
complained	O
to	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
	O
and	O
then	O
to	O
the	O
manager	B-A
,	O
but	O
the	O
intensity	O
of	O
rudeness	O
from	O
them	O
just	O
went	O
up.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
great	O
and	O
the	O
milkshakes	B-A
	O
are	O
even	O
better!	O

Stay	O
away	O
if	O
you're	O
claustrophobic	O

If	O
you're	O
in	O
the	O
'hood,	O
definitely	O
stop	O
in.	O

the	O
mushroom	B-A
barley	I-A
soup	I-A
	O
is	O
amazing.	O

On	O
the	O
recommendation	O
of	O
a	O
friend,	O
I	O
checked	O
out	O
Arezzo	O
with	O
my	O
wife.	O

I'm	O
glad	O
I	O
did	O
as	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
staff	B-A
	O
was	O
friendly,	O
courteous	O
and	O
efficient.	O

Their	O
duck	B-A
	O
here	O
is	O
also	O
absolutely	O
delicious.	O

This	O
is	O
definitely	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
places	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
continued	O
to	O
come	O
back	O
to	O
over	O
the	O
years.	O

While	O
it	O
was	O
large	O
and	O
a	O
bit	O
noisy,	O
the	O
drinks	B-A
	O
were	O
fantastic,	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
superb.	O

One	O
caveat:	O
Some	O
of	O
the	O
curried	B-A
casseroles	I-A
	O
can	O
be	O
a	O
trifle	O
harsh.	O

I	O
wasn't	O
impressed	O
and	O
it	O
wasn't	O
SPICEY????	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O

they	O

I	O
stumbled	O
upon	O
this	O
resteraunt	O
on	O
my	O
way	O
home	O
from	O
the	O

The	O
Management	B-A
	O
was	O
less	O
than	O
accomodating.	O

The	O
ambience	B-A
	O
is	O
also	O
more	O
laid-back	O
and	O
relaxed.	O

the	O
teas	B-A
	O
are	O

all	O
the	O

this	O

is	O
absolutely	O
beautiful.	O

The	O
design	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
intimate	O
and	O
romantic.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
wonderful	O
and	O
imaginative.	O

The	O
staff	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
sharp	O
and	O
they	O
look	O
good	O
too.	O

The	O
worst	O
though	O
was	O
the	O
taste	B-A
.	O

They	O
were	O
dry,	O
stale	O
and	O
pretty	O
flavorless.	O

The	O
fajita	B-A
	O
we	O
tried	O
was	O
tasteless	O
and	O
burned	O
and	O
the	O
mole	B-A
sauce	I-A
	O
was	O
way	O
too	O
sweet.	O

Stay	O
with	O
the	O
roasted	B-A
chickens	I-A
	O
and	O
you'll	O
be	O
fine.	O

The	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
is	O
warm,	O
comfortable,	O
artsy	O
and	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O

and	O
the	O

good.	O

The	O
steak	B-A
	O
melted	O
in	O
my	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
did	O
take	O
a	O
few	O
extra	O
minutes	O
to	O
come,	O
but	O
the	O
cute	O
waiters	B-A
'	O
jokes	O
and	O

made	O
up	O
for	O
it.	O

Most	O
importantly,	O
it	O
is	O
reasonably	O
priced	B-A

The	O
selection	B-A
of	I-A

	O
is	O
excellent	O
(I'm	O
not	O
used	O
to	O
having	O
much	O
choice	O
at	O
restaurants),	O
and	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
is	O
great.	O

Only	O
suggestion	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
skip	O
the	O
dessert	B-A
,	O
it	O
was	O
overpriced	O
and	O
fell	O
short	O
on	O
taste	B-A
.	O

Food	B-A
	O
was	O
decent,	O
but	O
not	O
great.	O

I	O
have	O
no	O
idea	O
why	O
this	O
restaurant	O
is	O
so	O
often	O
overlooked.	O

From	O
the	O

you	O

you're	O

i	O

what	O
some	O

about	O
this	O

with	O
a	O
quaint	O
bar	B-A
	O
and	O
good	O
food	B-A
.	O

I	O
find	O
that	O
most	O
Kosher	O
restaurants	O
are	O
average	O
to	O
good,	O
but	O
this	O
has	O
been	O
the	O
best	O
I've	O
eaten	O
so	O
far.	O

The	O
waiters	B-A
	O
ALWAYS	O
look	O
angry	O
and	O
even	O
ignore	O
their	O
high-tipping	O
regulars.	O

the	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
nice,	O
and	O
a	O
welcome	O
escape	O
from	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
SI	O
mall.	O

Yes,	O
they're	O
a	O
bit	O
more	O
expensive	O
then	O
typical,	O
but	O
then	O
again,	O
so	O
is	O
their	O
food	B-A
.	O

Not	O
terrible,	O
but	O
not	O
the	O
restaurant	O
in	O
the	O
reviews	O
of	O
2002.	O

I	O
can	O
say	O
that	O
the	O
wraps	B-A
,	O
burgers	B-A
	O
and	O
salads	B-A
	O
were	O
all	O
fresh,	O
tasty	O
and	O
the	O
mango	B-A
margareta	I-A
	O
at	O
$9	O
was	O
WELL	O
WORTH	O
the	O
money.	O

It	O
was	O
delicious	O
and	O
large!	O

Anywhere	O
else,	O
the	O
prices	B-A
	O
would	O
be	O
3x	O
as	O
high!	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
we	O
experienced	O
was	O
friendly	O
and	O
good.	O

Our	O
waiter	B-A
	O
was	O
friendly	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
shame	O
that	O
he	O
didnt	O
have	O
a	O
supportive	O
staff	B-A
	O
to	O
work	O
with.	O

The	O
folding	B-A
chair	I-A
	O

was	O
seated	O
at	O
was	O
uncomfortable.	O

As	O
we	O

I	O
watched	O
3	O

they	O
also	O
were.	O

The	O

I	O
know	O

I	O
went	O

I	O

me	O
crazy!	O

The	O

However,	O
the	O
food	B-A

Believe	O
me,	O
they	O
live	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
name.	O

Well,	O
it	O
happened	O
because	O
of	O
a	O
graceless	O
manager	B-A
	O
and	O
a	O
rude	O
bartender	B-A
	O
who	O
had	O
us	O
waiting	B-A
	O
20	O
minutes	O
for	O
drinks	B-A
,	O
and	O
then	O
tells	O
us	O
to	O
chill	O
out.	O

Not	O
only	O
is	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
great,	O
but	O
forming	O
conversation	O
around	O
a	O
table	O
is	O
so	O
easy	O
beacuse	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
can	O
be	O
both	O
romantic	O
and	O
comfortable.	O

When	O
the	O
dish	B-A
	O
arrived	O
it	O
was	O
blazing	O
with	O
green	B-A
chillis	I-A
,	O
definitely	O
not	O
edible	O
by	O
a	O
human.	O

The	O
absolute	O
worst	O
service	B-A
	O
I've	O
ever	O
experienced	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
below	O
average	O
(when	O
they	O
actually	O
gave	O
people	O
the	O
meals	B-A
	O
they	O
ordered).	O

It's	O
about	O
$7	O
for	O
lunch	B-A
	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
take-out	B-A
	O
or	O
dine-in	B-A
.	O

They	O
are	O
by	O
far	O
the	O
BEST	O
past	O
in	O
New	O
York.	O

I	O
have	O
eaten	O
here	O
several	O
times	O
before	O
attending	O
an	O
afternoon	O
performance.	O

Everything	O
is	O
very	O
cheap.	O

Be	O
sure	O
to	O
accompany	O
your	O
food	B-A
	O
with	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
fresh	B-A
juice	I-A
concoctions	I-A
.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
great	O
and	O
the	O
prices	B-A
	O
are	O
reasonable.	O

The	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
clean,	O
and	O
if	O
you	O
like	O
soul	B-A
food	I-A
,	O
then	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
place	O
to	O
be!	O

You'll	O
see	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
eating	O
there	O
after	O
church.	O

I	O
had	O
roast	B-A
chicken	I-A
	O
and	O
a	O

I've	O
been	O
a	O
regular	O

and	O
they	O
are	O

They	O
have	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
chicken	B-A
with	I-A
avocado	I-A
	O
and	O
good	O
tuna	B-A
	O
as	O
well.	O

It's	O
the	O
kind	O
of	O
place	O
I	O
like	O
to	O
support!	O

But	O
the	O
meals	B-A
	O
were	O
terrible.	O

My	O
chicken	B-A
	O
was	O
completely	O
dried	O
out	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
cold	O
side	O
and	O
the	O
sauce	B-A
	O
was	O
not	O
very	O
flavorful.	O

Malted	B-A
Milk	I-A

Gelato	I-A
	O
-	O
have	O
you	O
ever	O
in	O
your	O

of	O
anything	O
so	O
ridiculously	O

just	O

see	O
all	O
the	O
unbiased	O
positive	O

in	O
all	O
the	O

Way	O
too	O
much	O
money	O
for	O
such	O
a	O
terrible	O
meal	B-A
.	O

Would	O
not	O
recommend	O
anyone	O
to	O
go.	O

However,	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
absolutely	O
horrible.	O

A	O
con	O
was	O
the	O
slow	O
bar	B-A
service	I-A
.	O

Dessert	B-A
	O
was	O
also	O
to	O
die	O
for!	O

BTW,	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
good	O
.	O

We	O
loved	O
it	O
and	O
will	O
go	O
back!	O

I	O
came	O
again	O
weeks	O
later	O
with	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
and	O
again	O
had	O
a	O
very	O
nice	O
experience.	O

It's	O
eaten	O
with	O
black	B-A
vinegar	I-A
	O
and	O
shredded	B-A
ginger	I-A
.	O

The	O
unattractive	O
lighting	B-A
	O
made	O
me	O
want	O
to	O
gag,	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
overpriced,	O
there	O
was	O
the	O
most	O
awful	O
disco	B-A
pop	I-A
duo	I-A
	O
performing-and	O
my	O
escargot	B-A
	O
looked	O
like	O
it	O
might	O
crawl	O
off	O
the	O

We'll	O
definitly	O
be	O
back	O
again!	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
Italian	O
restaurant	O
in	O
the	O

it	O
is	O
a	O
cozy	O
place	B-A
	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
friends.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
always	O
great,	O
and	O
the	O
owner	B-A
	O
walks	O
around	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
you	O
enjoy.	O

because	O
the	O
waiters	B-A
	O
need	O
SEVERE	O
ATTITUE	O
ADJUSTMENTS.	O

There	O
are	O
numerous	O
shavue	O
restaurants	O
in	O
LA,	O
but	O
few	O
out	O
here.	O

Horrible	O
experience	O
-	O
stay	O

If	O
this	O

was	O
in	O
Manhattan,	O
I	O
would	O
definitely	O
go	O
more	O
often.	O

the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
delicious	O
and	O
highly	O

When	O

the	O
order	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
	O
gave	O
us	O
a	O
hard	O
time,	O
walked	O
away	O
then	O
came	O
back	O
with	O
a	O
paper	O

One	O
of	O

Do	O
not	O

to	O
this	O

since	O
i	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
neighborhood,	O
we	O

All	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
is	O
they	O

fantastic.	O

Dieters	O
stick	O
to	O

	O
or	O

So	O
for	O
a	O
filling	O
and	O
healthy	O
meal	B-A
	O
give	O
it	O
a	O
go.	O

I	O
can't	O
imagine	O
how	O
much	O
worse	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
if	O
we'd	O
gone	O
at	O
a	O

I	O

We	O

The	O

I	O

in	O
Brooklyn	O
that's	O
located	O
on	O
86	O
street,	O
right	O
underneath	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
here	O
was	O
great,	O
a	O
treat	O
from	O
beginning	O

end.	O

The	O
host	B-A
(owner)	I-A
	O
and	O

	O
are	O
personable	O
and	O
caring.	O

I	O
decided	O
to	O
try	O
out	O
this	O
place	O

hearing	O
about	O
it	O
in	O
many	O
magazines.	O

once.	O

I	O
started	O
going	O
to	O
dosa	O
hut	O
more	O
after	O
that.	O

We	O
were	O
wondering	O
why	O
they	O
were	O
there	O
to	O
make	O
our	O
dining	B-A
experience	I-A
	O
miserable?	O

Too	O
bad,	O
has	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
potential.	O

This	O
place	O
has	O
the	O
best	O
Indian	B-A
food	I-A
	O
in	O
New	O
York,	O
hands	O
down.	O

The	O
waiters	B-A
	O

very	O
friendly	O
and	O
helpful	O
and	O
if	O
you	O

they	O

Intimate	O
but	O
charming	O
interior	B-A
	O
with	O
extremely	O
friendly	O
and	O
attentive	O
service	B-A

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
as	O
creative	O
as	O
the	O
decor	B-A
	O
and	O
both	O
worked.	O

Siam	O
Square	O
is	O
fairly	O
new	O
to	O
the	O
neighborhood	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
in	O
time	O
will	O
gain	O
the	O
recognition	O
it	O
deserves.	O

My	O
first	O
experience	O
at	O
Siam	O
Square	O
was	O
very	O
pleasant.	O

I	O
have	O
gone	O
back	O
to	O
Siam	O
Square	O
many	O
times	O
since	O
and	O
everytime	O
I	O
am	O
very	O
satisfied	O
overall.	O

The	O
menu	B-A
	O
is	O
great,	O
with	O
a	O
good	O
selection	B-A
,	O
and	O
everything	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
tried	O
is	O
absolutely	O
delicious.	O

We	O
had	O
our	O
Christmas	O
party	O
at	O
Dos	O
Caminos	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
wonderful.	O

My	O
personal	O
favorite	O
is	O
Nick	O
and	O
Joe's.	O

The	O
sauce	B-A
	O
is	O
zesty	O
and	O
flavorful	O
and	O
the	O
crust	B-A
	O
is	O
nice	O
and	O
crispy.	O

This	O
place	O
has	O
the	O
best	O
sushi	B-A
	O
in	O
the	O
city.	O

They	O
have	O
an	O
excellent	O

	O
(the	O
rolls	B-A
with	I-A
crab	I-A
	O
are	O
really	O
great).	O

Everyone	O
who	O
works	O
there	O
(the	O

the	O
servers	B-A
)	O
is	O
so	O
helpful.	O

And	O
the	O

Favourites	O
include:	O
potato	B-A

the	O
lamb	B-A
.	O

Another	O
great	O
thing	O
about	O
Glechik-everything	O
is	O
very	O
cheap!	O

Unfortunately,	O
we	O
chose	O
this	O
spot	O
for	O
lunch	B-A
	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
done	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
walking	O
and	O
ended	O
up	O
at	O
the	O
South	O
St	O
Seaport.	O

But	O
regulars	O
know	O
that	O
the	O
sandwiches	B-A
	O
are	O
the	O
real	O
star	O
here.	O

The	O
skillfully	O
chosen	O
Portuguese	B-A
cheese	I-A
cart	I-A
	O
paired	O
with	O
quality	O
port	B-A
	O
provides	O
the	O
perfect	O
Iberian	O
ending.	O

My	O
friend	O
had	O
a	O
burger	B-A
	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
these	O
wonderful	O
blueberry	B-A
pancakes	I-A
.	O

We	O
were	O
so	O
happy	O
with	O
our	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
were	O
even	O
more	O
thrilled	O
when	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
bill	B-A
.	O

I	O
would	O
definitely	O
come	O
back	O
to	O
this	O
restaurant.	O

The	O
place	O
just	O
isn't	O
ready	O
for	O

All	O
toppings	B-A
	O
are	O
so	O
fresh	O
you'd	O
think	O
they	O
had	O
their	O
own	O
vegetable	O
garden	O
and	O
the	O
crust	B-A
	O
is	O
so	O
perfect,	O
that	O
one	O
actually	O
thinks	O
of	O
how	O
it	O
was	O
made.	O

Quartino	O

I	O
thought	O
the	O

	O
isn't	O
cheap	O
at	O
all	O
compared	O
to	O

you	O

waiting	B-A
	O
can	O
really	O
be	O
a	O
nightmare.	O

Here's	O
the	O
thing,	O
you're	O
in	O
the	O
best	O
city	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
for	O
restaurants.	O

Go	O
spend	O
your	O
money	O
somewhere	O
that	O
really	O
wows	O
you.	O

The	O
crowd	O
was	O
older	O
and	O
the	O
restaurant	O
is	O
very	O
cramped,	O
but	O
it	O
has	O
old	O
school	O
charm.	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
real	O
gem	O
of	O
a	O
place.	O

I	O
think	O
this	O
a	O
a	O
wonderful	O
place.	O

First	O
walking	O
in	O
the	O
place	B-A
	O
seemed	O
to	O
have	O
great	O
ambience	B-A
.	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
Kitchenette	O
this	O
weekend	O
for	O
brunch	B-A
.	O

This	O
place	O
doesn't	O
get	O
the	O
publicity	O
that	O
Sylvias	O
Soul	O
Food	O
restaurant	O
does,	O
but	O
it	O
should.	O

Just	O
because	O
P	O
Diddy	O
had	O
a	O
party	O
at	O
Butter	O
doesn't	O
mean	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
automatically	O
impressed.	O

Even	O
for	O
two	O
very	O
hungry	O
people	O
there	O
is	O
plenty	O
of	O
food	B-A
	O
left	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
home	O
(it	O
reheats	O
really	O
well	O
also).	O

Like	O
I	O
said,	O
Nick	O
and	O
Joe's	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
everyone's	O
favorite,	O
but	O
it's	O
mine.	O

The	O
help	O
was	O
extremely	O
nice	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
rush	O
us.	O

Then	O
they	O
somehow	O
made	O
a	O
dry	O
and	O
burnt	O
crust	B-A
,	O
around	O
a	O
raw	O
and	O
cold	O
inside.	O

It's	O
just	O
good	O
food	B-A
,	O
nothing	O
more	O
and	O
that's	O
all	O
we	O
want!	O

DON'T	O
KNOW	O
WHAT	O
THE	O
OTHERS	O
ON	O
THE	O
BLOCK	O
WERE	O
LIKE	O
BUT	O
WE	O
WERE	O
PLEASED	O
WITH	O
OUR	O
CHOICE.	O

Average	O
cake	B-A
	O
thats	O
been	O
courted	O
by	O
a	O
LOT	O

It's	O
cute	O
and	O
simple	O
and	O
I	O
loved	O
it.	O

My	O

Everytime	O

The	O
one	O
positive	O
thing	O
I	O

I	O
left	O
feeling	O
satisfied	O
(not	O
stuffed)	O
and	O
it	O
felt	O
good	O
to	O
know	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
healthy	O
lunch	B-A
.	O

I'm	O
almost	O
tempted	O
to	O
give	O
this	O
place	O
a	O
bad	O
review	O
so	O
I	O
can	O
keep	O
the	O
crowds	O
away...been	O
going	O
there	O
on	O
and	O
off	O
for	O
a	O
year	O
now	O
and	O
it's	O
really	O
my	O
fave	O
hang	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
city.	O

When	O
she	O
complained,	O
the	O
waitress	B-A
	O
said,	O
Sorry.	O

The	O
quality	B-A
of	I-A
the	I-A
meat	I-A
	O
was	O
on	O
par	O
with	O
your	O
local	O
grocery	O
store.	O

They	O
specialize	O
in	O
smoothies	B-A
	O
and	O
fresh	B-A
juices	I-A
.	O

It	O
first	O
came	O
well	O
done,	O
and	O
I	O
politely	O
sent	O
it	O
back.	O

I	O
recommend	O
the	O
black	B-A
roasted	I-A
codfish	I-A
,	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
best	O
dish	B-A
	O
of	O
the	O
evening.	O

The	O
manager	B-A
	O
then	O
told	O
us	O
we	O
could	O
order	O
from	O
whatever	O
menu	B-A
	O
we	O
wanted	O
but	O
by	O
that	O
time	O
we	O
were	O
so	O
annoyed	O
with	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
resturant	O
that	O
we	O
let	O
and	O
went	O
some	O
place	O
else.	O

In	O
mi	O
burrito,	O
here	O
was	O
nothing	O
but	O
dark	O
chicken	B-A
	O
that	O
had	O
that	O
cooked	O
last	O
week	O
and	O
just	O
warmed	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
microwave	O
taste	B-A
.	O

during	O
busy	O

i	O
recommend	O
that	O
you	O
make	O
a	O
reservation	B-A

Don't	O
waste	O
your	O
time	O
or	O
your	O
money.	O

it's	O
good	O
but,	O
like	O
the	O

never	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
the	O

this	O
is	O

analogy.	O

it	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
warm	O
experience.	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
Common	O
Stock	O
for	O
brunch	B-A
	O

I	O
was	O

impressed.	O

now	O
called	O
nikki	O
sushi,	O
sushi	B-A
	O

OK.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
also	O
outstanding	O
and	O
is	O
served	B-A
	O
quite	O
quickly.	O

I	O
just	O
have	O
nothing	O
to	O
say	O
about	O
this	O
place	O
that	O
is	O
negative	O
except	O
that	O
it's	O
not	O
a	O
cheap	O

it's	O
SO	O
worth	O
it.	O

and	O
the	O

	O
is	O

Maybe	O
it's	O
that	O
most	O
of	O

have	O

It	O
doesn't	O
look	O

the	O

it's	O
a	O

I	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
the	O

We	O
requested	O
they	O
re-slice	O
the	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
returned	O
to	O
us	O
in	O
small	O

The	O

however,	O
is	O

the	O

(horrible	O

	O
As	O

I	O

stopped	O

there	O
to	O
pick	O
up	O

and	O
it	O
seems	O
a	O
very	O
relaxing	O
place	B-A
;	O
also,	O
the	O
bar	B-A
	O
looks	O
nice.	O

The	O
ambiance	B-A
	O
was	O
fine,	O
a	O
little	O
loud	O
but	O
still	O
nice	O
and	O
romantic.	O

the	O

Who	O
said	O
go	O
when	O
the	O

quiet	O
during	O
the	O
day?	O

Can	O
be	O
a	O
bit	O
busy	O
around	O
peak	O

of	O

with	O

that	O
very	O
much	O
fits	O
the	O

However,	O
there	O
is	O
just	O
something	O
so	O
great	O
about	O
being	O
outdoors	B-A
,	O
in	O
great	O
landscaping,	O
enjoying	O
a	O
casual	B-A
drink	I-A
	O
that	O
makes	O
going	O
to	O
this	O
place	B-A
	O
worthwhile.	O

We	O
were	O
seated	O
promptly	O
in	O
close	O
proximity	O
to	O
the	O
dance	B-A

If	O
you	O
are	O
here	O
as	O
a	O
pre-show	B-A

,	O
hop	O
in	O
a	O
cab	O
and	O
take	O
the	O
extra	O
10	O
minutes	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
uptown	O

A	O
plus	O

the	O

in	O
their	O

that	O
provided	O
for	O
great	O
eye-candy	O
while	O
I	O
was	O
there.	O

The	O
comments	O
about	O
fried	B-A
foods	I-A
	O
is	O
correct	O
(below)	O
but	O
the	O
other	O
dishes	B-A
,	O
including	O
the	O
lamb	B-A
entree	I-A
	O
and	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
salads	B-A
(avocado	I-A
shrimp)	I-A
	O
were	O
quite	O
good.	O

It's	O
best	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
a	O
cold	O
night	O
with	O
a	O
close	O
friend	O
or	O
a	O
good	O
book.	O

Slow	O
service	B-A
,	O
but	O
when	O
you're	O
hanging	O
around	O
with	O
groups	O
of	O
10	O
or	O
20,	O
who	O
really	O
notices?	O

The	O
sauce	B-A
	O
is	O
excellent	O
(very	O
fresh)	O
with	O
dabs	B-A
of	I-A
real	I-A
mozzarella	I-A
.	O

Don't	O
ever	O
bother	O
-	O
the	O
drinks	B-A
	O
were	O
awful,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
people	B-A
	O
who	O
work	O
there	O
that	O
really	O
made	O
this	O
the	O
worst	O
experience	O
at	O
dining	B-A
.	O

The	O
room	B-A
	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
plain,	O
but	O
it's	O
difficult	O
to	O
make	O
such	O
a	O
small	O
place	B-A
	O
exciting	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
suggest	O
that	O
as	O
a	O
reason	O
not	O
to	O
go.	O

Prices	B-A
	O
even	O
outside	O
of	O
restaurant	O
week	O
were	O
great.	O

A	O
small,	O
outdoor	B-A

for	O
a	O
private,	O

space	B-A
	O
to	O
study	O
alone	O
or	O
meet	O
up	O
with	O
friends.	O

Before	O
the	O
place	O
didn't	O
call	O
my	O
attention.	O

And	O
all	O
the	O
[female]	B-A
servers	I-A
	O
are	O
cute	O
too,	O
which	O
is	O
always	O
nice.	O

The	O
best	O
dessert	B-A
,	O
a	O
chocolate	B-A
and	I-A
peanut	I-A
butter	I-A
tart	I-A
,	O
isn't	O
particularly	O
Hawaiian,	O
but	O
it's	O
a	O
small	O
world	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
sweets	B-A
.	O

for	O
an	O
appetizer	B-A
,	O
their	O
calamari	B-A

is	O
a	O
winner.	O

Satay	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
favorite	O
haunts	O
on	O
Washington	O
where	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
and	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
always	O
on	O
the	O
money.	O

After	O
dinner	B-A
	O
I	O
heard	O
music	B-A
	O
playing	O
and	O
discovered	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
lounge	B-A
	O
downstairs.	O

But	O
now	O
that	O
it's	O
under	O
new	O
ownership	O
and	O
has	O
been	O
renovated,	O
it	O
looks	O
great.	O

The	O
room	B-A
	O
is	O
a	O
gorgeous,	O
bi-level	B-A
space	I-A
	O
and	O
the	O
long	B-A
bar	I-A
	O
perfect	O
for	O
a	O
drink	B-A
.	O

Now	O
we	O
moved	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
and	O
every	O
visit	O
to	O
NYC	O
includes	O
a	O
stop	O
here.	O

Two	O
complaints-	O
their	O
appetizer	B-A
selection	I-A
	O
stinks,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
nice	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
mozzarella	B-A
sticks	I-A
	O
on	O
the	O
menu	B-A
.	O

I	O
don't	O
remember	O
what	O
we	O
had;	O
nothing	O
was	O
memorable.	O

It	O
is	O
bland	O
and	O
nothing	O
extrodinary.	O

I	O
was	O
especially	O
impressed	O
during	O
the	O
bday	O
party	O
when	O
the	O
waitstaff	B-A
	O
went	O
above	O
and	O
beyond	O
in	O
helping	O
me	O
decorate	O
and	O
bring	O
out	O
a	O
bday	O
cake	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
offering	O
prompt	O
and	O
friendly	O
service	B-A
	O
to	O
a	O
15	O
person	O
party.	O

The	O
chicken	B-A
and	I-A
falafel	I-A
platters	I-A
	O
were	O
nondescript	O
combinations	O
with	O
fresh	B-A
leaf	I-A
salad	I-A
.	O

Every	O
time	O
I	O
visit	O
NYC,	O
I	O
come	O
here.	O

I've	O
been	O
coming	O
here	O
regularly	O
since	O
it	O
opened,	O
about	O
2	O
years	O
ago.	O

The	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
takes	O
you	O
to	O
that	O
place,	O
the	O
place	O
many	O
dream	O
of.	O

several	O
times	O
and	O
put	O
up	O
with	O
the	O
waiters	B-A
'	O
bad	O
manners,	O
knowing	O
that	O
their	O
job	O
isn't	O
easy.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
great	O
(maybe	O
even	O
borderline	O
nagging	O
but	O
at	O
least	O
you	O
get	O
attention),	O
the	O
desserts	B-A
	O
are	O
excellent	O
and	O
the	O
coffee	B-A
	O
is	O
so	O
very	O
good...	O

We	O
were	O
seated	O
next	O
to	O
a	O
couple	O
whose	O
kitchen	O
was	O
being	O
renovated	O
and	O
we	O
agreed	O
since	O
we're	O
all	O
foodies	O
who	O
eat	O
out	O
a	O
lot	O
-	O
that	O
this	O
wasn't	O
a	O
place	O
we'd	O
return	O
to.	O

They	O
are	O
served	B-A
	O
on	O
Focacchia	B-A
bread	I-A
	O
and	O
are	O
to	O
die	O
for.	O

While	O
the	O
smoothies	B-A
	O
are	O
a	O
little	O
big	O
for	O
me,	O
the	O
fresh	B-A
juices	I-A
	O
are	O
the	O
best	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
had!	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
just	O
OKAY,	O
and	O
it's	O
almost	O
not	O
worth	O
going	O
unless	O
you're	O
getting	O
the	O
pialla	B-A
,	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
dish	B-A
	O
that's	O
really	O
good.	O

The	O
guac	B-A
	O
is	O
fresh,	O
yet	O
lacking	O
flavor	B-A
,	O
we	O
like	O
to	O
add	O
our	O
fresh	B-A
salsa	I-A
	O
into	O
it.	O

The	O
new	B-A
menu	I-A
	O
has	O
a	O
few	O
creative	O
items,they	O
were	O
smart	O
enough	O
to	O
keep	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
old	O
favorites	O
(but	O
they	O
raised	O
the	O
prices	B-A
),	O
the	O
staff	B-A
	O
is	O
friendly	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
time,	O
but	O
I	O
must	O
agree	O
with	O
the	O
person	O
that	O
wrote	O
about	O
their	O
favorite	O
words:	O
No,	O
can't,	O
sorry...,	O
boy,	O
they	O
won't	O
bend	O
the	O
rules	O
for	O
anyone.	O

It'	O
only	O
open	O
for	O
lunch	B-A
	O
but	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
so	O
good!	O

Greek	B-A
food	I-A
	O
you	O
will	O
love	O

I	O

what	O

of	O
