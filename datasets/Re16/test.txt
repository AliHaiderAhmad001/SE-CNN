We	O
were	O

rudely	O
here	O
one	O

The	O

This	O

a	O

meal	B-A

We	O
never	O

The	O

The	O

great!	O

They	O
are	O
not	O

anything.	O

Overrated	O

–	O
I	O
was	O
highly	O
disappointed	O
in	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
at	O
Pagoda.	O

The	O

the	O
honey	B-A
walnut	I-A

,	O
the	O
few	O
they	O
actually	O
give	O
you.....were	O
not	O
good.	O

The	O
prices	O
are	O
outrageous,	O
especially	O
since	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
actually	O
less	O
satisfying	O
than	O
most	O
neighborhood	O
Chinese	O
establishments.	O

Nice	O

I	O
will	O

A	O

of	O
5	O
of	O
us	O
went	O
there	O
for	O
Sunday	O
brunch	O
and	O
sat	O
outside.	O

Everyone	O
that	O
sat	O
in	O
the	O

agreed	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
worst	O
service	B-A
	O
we	O
had	O
ever	O
received.	O

Our	O
waiter	B-A
	O
was	O
non-existent	O
and	O
after	O

over	O
an	O
hour	O
after	O
we	O
ordered,	O
we	O
were	O
not	O

any	O
water	O

I	O
complained	O
to	O
the	O
manager	B-A
,	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
even	O
apologetic.	O

I	O
will	O

She	O
had	O
heard	O
from	O
a	O

about	O
this	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
great!	O

It's	O
*very*	O
reasonably	O
priced,	O
esp	O
for	O
the	O
quality	O
of	O
the	O

.	O

I	O
had	O
the	O

Finally	O
a	O
meal	B-A
	O
that	O
you	O
will	O
remember	O
for	O
a	O
long	O
time!	O

–	O
In	O
a	O
age	O
of	O
incremental	O
cost	O
cutting	O
in	O
restaurants,	O
its	O
nice	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
place	O
that	O
bucks	O
that	O
trend,	O
and	O
just	O
plain	O
delivers	O
high	O
quality	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
good	O
service	B-A
,	O
period.	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
place	B-A
	O
to	O
relax	O
and	O
enjoy	O
the	O
finest	O
quality	O
food	B-A
	O
the	O
industry	O
can	O
offer.	O

Caution	O
-	O
its	O
real	O
food	B-A
	O
for	O
people	O
who	O
love	O
the	O
best.	O

Some	O
of	O
the	O
food	O
is	O
clearly	O
oriented	O
toward	O
foodies	O
(like	O
me)	O
so	O
if	O
your	O
not	O
a	O
foodie	O
(nothing	O
wrong	O
with	O
that)-	O
head	O
over	O
to	O
McDonalds	O
or	O
some	O
Ruby	O
Tuesday	O
and	O
have	O
at	O
it!	O

If	O
your	O
looking	O
for	O
real	O
quality	O
(not	O
the	O
BS	O
that	O
is	O
seen	O
on	O
yelp	O
ratings	O
-	O
which	O
allegedly	O
recently	O
got	O
in	O
trouble	O
for	O
"adjusting"	O
ratings),	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
get	O
in	O
here!	O

Very	O
Disappointing	O

–	O
I	O
took	O
my	O
parents	O
here	O
for	O
their	O
anniversary-very	O
very	O
disappointed!!!	O

I	O
liked	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
very	O
much	O
but	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
not	O
worth	O
the	O
price.	O

I	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
a	O
sushi	O
guru	O
but	O
I	O
can	O
tell	O
you	O
that	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
here	O
is	O
just	O
okay	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
not	O
much	O
else	O
to	O
it.	O

Rice	B-A
	O
is	O
too	O
dry,	O
tuna	B-A
	O
wasn't	O
so	O
fresh	O
either.	O

Nothing	O
really	O
came	O
across	O
as	O
outstanding.	O

Very	O
disappointed.	O

I	O
have	O
eaten	O
here	O
three	O
times	O
and	O
have	O
found	O
the	O
quality	O
and	O
variety	O
of	O
the	O
fish	B-A
	O
to	O
be	O
excellent.	O

However,	O
the	O
value	O
and	O
service	B-A
	O
are	O
both	O
severely	O
lacking.	O

Portions	O
contain	O
less	O
fish	O
than	O
one	O
would	O
expect,	O
particularly	O
since	O
prices	O
are	O
in	O
line	O
with	O
the	O
best	O
sushi	O
places	O
in	O
NYC	O
(Masa	O
excluded,	O
of	O
course).	O

Furthermore,	O
while	O
the	O
fish	B-A
	O
is	O
unquestionably	O
fresh,	O
rolls	B-A
	O
tend	O
to	O
be	O
inexplicably	O
bland.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
ranges	O
from	O
mediocre	O
to	O
offensive.	O

On	O
a	O
recent	O
trip,	O
our	O
waiter	B-A
	O
was	O
extremely	O
dismissive,	O
while	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
three	O
staff	B-A
members	I-A
	O
waited	O
hand-and-foot	O
on	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
Japanese	O
girls	O
seated	O
nearby.	O

We	O
were	O
then	O
charged	O
for	O
their	O
most	O
expensive	O
sake	O
($20+	O
per	O
serving)	O
when	O
we	O
in	O
fact	O
drank	O
a	O
sake	O
of	O
less	O
than	O
half	O
that	O
price.	O

But	O
Im	O
sure	O
this	O
was	O
just	O
an	O
honest	O
mistake...	O

Freshest	O
sushi	B-A
	O
	O
–	O
I	O
love	O
this	O
restaurant	B-A
.	O

They	O
pay	O
such	O
detail	O
to	O
everything	O
from	O
miso	B-A
soup	I-A
	O
to	O
complex	O
rolls	B-A
.	O

The	O
sashimi	B-A
	O
was	O
the	O
freshest	O
and	O
most	O
tender	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
tasted.	O

Their	O
apps	B-A
	O
are	O
all	O
delicious.	O

The	O
only	O
drawback	O
is	O
that	O
this	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
really	O
expensive	O
and	O
the	O
portions	B-A
	O
are	O
on	O
the	O
small	O
side.	O

But	O
the	O
space	B-A
	O
is	O
small	O
and	O
lovely,	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
helpful.	O

You	O
are	O
bound	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
very	O
charming	O
time.	O

Not	O
recommanded!!!	O

–	O
The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
not	O
great	O
&	O
the	O
waiters	B-A
	O
were	O
rude.	O

It	O
is	O
not	O
worth	O
going	O
at	O
all	O
and	O
spend	O
your	O
money	O
there!!!	O

great	O
service	B-A
	O

–	O
Pretty	O
cheap	O
for	O
sit	O
down	O
Mexican	O
AND	O
downtown.	O

my	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
stellar!	O

the	O
bus	B-A
boy	I-A
	O
even	O
spotted	O
that	O
my	O
table	O
was	O
shaking	O
a	O
stabilized	O
it	O
for	O
me.	O

food	B-A
	O
was	O
fine,	O
with	O
a	O
some	O
little-tastier-than-normal	O
salsa	B-A
.	O

If	O
you're	O
in	O
the	O
area	O
you	O
shouldn't	O
be	O
disappointed.	O

Ok....	O
–	O
Maybe	O
I	O
went	O
in	O
on	O
someone's	O
bad	O
day....	O

the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
great,	O
the	O
margaritas	B-A
	O
too	O
but	O
the	O
waitress	B-A
	O
was	O
too	O
busy	O
being	O
nice	O
to	O
her	O
other	O
larger	O
party	O
than	O
to	O
take	O
better	O
care	O
of	O
my	O
friend	O
and	O
me.	O

Took	O
forever	O
to	O
get	O
our	O
order	O
taken,	O
water	O
refills	O
were	O
too	O
much	O
to	O
ask	O
for	O
and	O
the	O
only	O
time	O
she	O
was	O
fast	O
was	O
when	O
we	O
asked	O
for	O
our	O
bill	O
when	O
we	O
could	O
get	O
her	O
attention.	O

I	O
don't	O
know	O
if	O
I'll	O
be	O
back....	O

and	O
the	O
turkey	O
sandwich.	O

My	O
g/f	O
and	O
I	O
both	O
agreed	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
mediocre	O
especially	O
considering	O
the	O
price.	O

We	O
are	O
locals,	O
and	O
get	O
the	O
feeling	O
the	O
only	O
way	O
this	O
place	B-A
	O
survives	O
with	O
such	O
average	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
because	O
most	O
customers	O
are	O
probably	O
one-time	O
customer	O
tourists.	O

Service	B-A
	O
was	O
decent.	O

Drinks	B-A
	O
were	O
good.	O

Unless	O
you	O
are	O
just	O
stopping	O
in	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
drinks	B-A
	O
I	O
wouldn't	O
recommend	O
going	O
here.	O

You	O
are	O
likely	O
to	O
be	O
disappointed.	O

Excellent	O
food	B-A
,	O
nice	O

,	O
fairly	O

–	O
I	O
loved	O
the	O
pumpkin	B-A

	O
and	O
the	O
goat	B-A
cheese	I-A
gnocchi	I-A
	O
(5	O

ones	O
to	O
a	O
plate	O
instead	O
of	O
20	O
or	O
so	O
little	O
gnocchis)	O
and	O
my	O
sister	O
loved	O
her	O
filet	B-A
mignon	I-A
on	I-A
top	I-A
of	I-A
spinach	I-A
and	I-A
mashed	I-A
potatoes	I-A
.	O

The	O
ambiance	B-A
	O
was	O
a	O
peaceful	O
and	O
relaxing	O
break	O
amongst	O
all	O
the	O
kids	O
running	O
around	O
in	O
Downtown	O
Disney.	O

It	O
was	O
romantic	O
-	O
and	O
even	O
nice	O
even	O
with	O
my	O
sister,	O
reminded	O
me	O
of	O
Italy,	O
and	O
had	O
artwork	B-A
	O
and	O
music	B-A
	O
that	O
kept	O
up	O
the	O
feeling	O
of	O
being	O
in	O
a	O
Mediterrean	O
villa.	O

I	O
recommend	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
night	O
when	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
splurge!	O
(it	O
was	O
a	O
bit	O
expensive)	O

Best	O
Indian	B-A
food	I-A
	O
in	O
L.A.	O

–	O
I've	O
been	O
to	O
over	O
a	O
dozen	O
Indian	O
places	O
in	O
L.A.,	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
still	O
my	O
favorite.	O

The	O
best	O
thing	O
is,	O
the	O
prices	O
are	O
also	O
quite	O
reasonable.	O

The	O
chicken	B-A
curry	I-A
	O
and	O
chicken	B-A
tikka	I-A
masala	I-A
	O
are	O
my	O
favorite	O
meat	O
dishes.	O

The	O
chana	B-A
masala	I-A
(garbanzo	I-A
beans)	I-A
	O
are	O
also	O
excellent.	O

It's	O
located	O
in	O
a	O
strip	O
mall	O
near	O
the	O
Beverly	O
Center,	O
not	O
the	O
greatest	O
location	B-A
,	O
but	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
keeps	O
me	O
coming	O
back	O
for	O
more.	O

hidden	O
little	O
jem	O

–	O
tucked	O
away	O
over	O

the	O
Beverly	O

Never	O
too	O
crowded	O
and	O
always	O
great	O
service	B-A
.	O

I	O
think	O
I	O
have	O
probably	O
tried	O
each	O
item	O
on	O
their	O
menu	B-A
	O
at	O
least	O
once	O
it	O
is	O
all	O
excellent.	O

I	O
can	O
highly	O
recommend	O
their	O
various	O
saag	B-A
	O
and	O
paneer	B-A
	O
and	O
korma	B-A
.	O

You	O
routinely	O
see	O
Indian	O
families	O
and	O
friends	O
dining	O
there,	O
which	O
is	O
always	O
a	O
good	O
sign.	O

I	O
appreciate	O
their	O
delivery	B-A
	O
too.	O

Nice	O
food	B-A
	O
but	O
no	O
spice!	O

–	O
I	O
really	O
enjoyed	O
my	O

,	O
saag	B-A

,	O
samosas	B-A
,	O
naan	B-A
,	O
etc.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
all	O
good	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
way	O
too	O
mild.	O

Normally,	O
places	O
ask	O
how	O
hot	O
you	O
want	O
it,	O
but	O
they	O
didn't.	O

I	O
should	O
have	O
thought	O
to	O
bring	O
it	O
up	O
but	O
never	O
expected	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
to	O
be	O
that	O
mild.	O

I	O
will	O
give	O
them	O
another	O
chance	O
and	O
make	O
sure	O
to	O
tell	O
them	O
to	O
kick	O
it	O
up	O
several	O
notches.	O

The	O
naan	B-A
	O
was	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
I've	O
had	O
and	O
I	O
really	O
enjoyed	O
the	O

not	O
too	O

Even	O
the	O
chickpeas	B-A
,	O
which	O
I	O
normally	O
find	O
too	O
dry,	O
were	O
good.	O

And	O
they	O
packaged	O
everything	O
nicely	O
so	O
it	O
didn't	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
simply	O
unforgettable!	O

I	O
had	O
the	O

with	O
a	O

The	O

was	O
an	O
added	O
bonus,	O
it	O
looked	O
just	O
as	O
great	O
as	O
it	O

My	O

–	O
The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
here	O
is	O
incredible,	O
though	O
the	O
quality	O
is	O
inconsistent	O
during	O
lunch	B-A
.	O

Dinners	B-A
	O
have	O
always	O
been	O
excellent,	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
food	O
quality.	O

The	O
open	B-A

	O
is	O
a	O
bargain	O
for	O
the	O
heap	O

Also,	O
they	O
serve	O
THE	O
best	O

	O
in	O
America,	O
with	O
a	O
drizzle	O
of	O
fragrant	O
olive	O
oil	O
(which,	O
I	O
believe	O
is	O
the	O
traditional	O
way)!	O

The	O
only	O
drawback	O
is	O
the	O
crowded	O
seating	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
slow	O
service	B-A

There	O
have	O

several	O
occasions	O
when	O
we've	O
just	O
not	O
gotten	O
some	O

However,	O
this	O

is	O
a	O
gem,	O
and	O
I	O
won't	O
stop	O
going	O

	O

–	O
My	O
first	O
time	O
to	O
dine	O
at	O
this	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
was	O
with	O
my	O
son	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
absolutely	O
horrible!	O

We	O
waited	O
over	O
30	O
minutes	O
for	O
our	O
drinks	O
and	O
over	O
1	O
1/2	O
hours	O
for	O
our	O
food.	O

I	O
swore	O
never	O
to	O
return	O
for	O
a	O
warm	O
beer	B-A
	O
and	O
mediocre	O
meal	B-A
.	O

HOWEVER,	O
one	O
Sunday	O
afternoon	O
my	O
husband	O
and	O
I	O
did	O
go	O
(although	O
with	O
my	O
loud	O
protests)	O
and	O
were	O
pleasantly	O
surprised.	O

The	O
band	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
attentive.	O

Outside	O
in	O
the	O
area	O
between	O
the	O
restaurant	O
and	O
the	O
park,	O
children	O
were	O
running	O
around	O
while	O
their	O
parents	O
sipped	O
wine.	O

We	O
ordered	O
a	O
selection	O
of	O
the	O
small	O
plates,	O
and	O
the	O
shoe	B-A
string	I-A
onions	I-A

,	O
grilled	B-A
asparagus	I-A
	O
and	O
fried	B-A
brie	I-A
with	I-A
fruit	I-A
	O
were	O
all	O
very	O
good.	O

It	O
was	O
like	O
dining	O
at	O
a	O
completely	O
different	O
restaurant.	O

We	O
have	O
since	O
returned	O
and	O
also	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
experience,	O
sampling	O
more	O
small	O
plates	O
and	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
the	O
beer	B-A
	O
(	O
cold	O
and	O
good).	O

We	O
did	O
have	O
the	O
same	O
waiter	B-A
	O
the	O
second	O
time,	O
so	O
maybe	O
the	O
service	O
is	O
spotty	O
and	O
our	O
luck	O
is	O
good.	O

Sunday	O
afternoons	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
band	B-A
	O
playing	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
lots	O
of	O
fun.	O

What	O

the	O

once	O

the	O

is	O
so	O

you	O
can	O
be	O
in	O
and	O
out	O

I	O
went	O
there	O
with	O
a	O
friend	O
from	O
out	O
of	O
town...	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
both	O
very	O
impressed!	O

Went	O
on	O
a	O
Monday	O
night,	O
so	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
wait	O
for	O
a	O
table.	O

The	O
sushi	B-A
	O
was	O
excellent	O
and	O
the	O
wait	B-A
staff	I-A
	O
was	O
quick.	O

The	O
price	O
was	O
right	O
too.	O

The	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
was	O
just	O
okay.	O

Space	B-A
	O
was	O
limited,	O
but	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
made	O
up	O
for	O
it.	O

I'd	O
go	O
back	O
there	O
in	O
a	O
heartbeat.	O

Should	O
have	O
gone	O
to	O
Trader	O
Joe's	O
and	O
had	O
frozen	O

:(	O

–	O
My	O
family	O
went	O
on	O
a	O
midweek	O
evening	O
to	O
have	O
dinner.	O

The	O
restaurant	O
was	O
80	O
%	O
full	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
sign	O
posted	O
"wait	O
to	O
be	O
seated."	O

Well	O
I	O
guess	O
it's	O
hard	O
to	O
be	O
seated	O
when	O
one	O
is	O
invisible	O
to	O
the	O
staff	B-A
.	O

We	O
stood	O
there	O
for	O
10	O
minutes	O
while	O
employees	B-A
	O
walked	O
back	O
and	O
forth	O
ignoring	O
us.	O

Finally,	O
my	O
wife	O
stood	O
face	O
to	O
face	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
staff	B-A
	O
and	O
she	O
asked,	O
"Are	O
you	O
waiting	O
for	O
a	O
table?"	O

Once	O
seated	O
it	O
took	O
about	O
30	O
minutes	O
to	O
finally	O
get	O
the	O
meal.	O

The	O

The	O
Caesar	B-A
salad	I-A
	O
I	O
ordered	O
had	O
so	O
much	O
lemon	O
I	O
couldn't	O
eat	O
it.	O

The	O
pizza	O
was	O
slightly	O
reminescent	O
of	O
Baker's	O
Beach	O
pizza	O
which	O
occupied	O
the	O
the	O
space	O
years	O
ago	O
(a	O
distant	O
second).	O

It	O
was	O
decent	O
but	O
nothing	O
exceptional.	O

This	O
establishment	O
is	O
consistent	O
with	O
my	O
feelings	O
of	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
Chow	O
Foods	O
group.	O

We	O
used	O
to	O
frequent	O
most	O
of	O
their	O
restaurants	O
but	O
over	O
the	O
years	O
each	O
one	O
has	O
really	O
been	O
disapointing.	O

I'm	O
a	O
born	O
and	O
bred	O
Southend	O
resident	O
and	O
was	O
excited	O
to	O
hear	O
of	O
this	O
restaurant	O
opening.	O

Well,	O
I	O
guess	O
maybe	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
beneficial	O
for	O
the	O
management	O
to	O
pay	O
a	O
visit	O
to	O

reviews.	O

I	O
noice	O
most	O
reviews	O
mention	O
the	O
bad	O
service.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
ok,	O
but	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
so	O
poor	O
that	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
cold	O
buy	O
the	O
time	O
everyone	O
in	O
my	O

was	O

Even	O
then,	O
the	O
order	O
was	O
not	O
correct	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
still	O
waiting	O
for	O
a	O
couple	O
items.	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
very	O
hard	O
time	O
getting	O
the	O
waitress	B-A
'	O
attention	O
and	O
finally	O
had	O
to	O
get	O
up	O

go	O

to	O
speak	O
to	O
a	O
manager.	O

As	O
it	O

out	O
the	O

	O

when	O
he	O

When	O
the	O

he	O
only	O

the	O

off	O
the	O

made	O
my	O
1st	O

to	O
the	O

When	O
I	O

there	O
I	O

where	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
was	O
cozy	O
&	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
horrible!	O

I	O
waited	O
for	O
10-15	O
minutes	O
for	O
service	B-A
	O
ordered	O
a	O
beer	O
&	O
was	O

there	O
with	O
my	O

we	O

chinese	B-A
food	I-A
	O
i	O
have	O
tasted	O
in	O
a	O
long	O
time	O

–	O
we	O
got	O
a	O
groupon	O
for	O
pagoda	O
and	O
decided	O
to	O
try	O
it	O
on	O
a	O
thursday	O
night.	O

there	O
was	O
a	O
guy	O
playing	O
the	O
piano	O
and	O
singing	O
at	O
the	O
bar	O
area	O
which	O
was	O
separate	O
from	O
the	O
dinning	O
area.	O

You	O
can	O
easily	O
hear	O
him	O
though	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
pleasant	O
sound	O
and	O
not	O
overbearing.	O

the	O
ambiance	B-A
	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	O
was	O
nice	O
and	O
good	O
for	O
fine	O
dinning.	O

not	O
too	O
fine	O
thought	O
that	O
you	O
feel	O
uncomfortable	O
and	O
have	O
to	O
dress	O
up.	O

the	O
staff	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
nice	O
and	O
courteous	O
and	O
obviously	O
chinese.	O

we	O
ordered	O
the	O
honey	O
walnut	O
prawns	O
which	O
we	O
always	O
order	O
at	O
every	O
chinese	O
restaurant	O
to	O
determine	O
the	O
quality	O
of	O
food.	O

First	O
off,	O
the	O
food	O
came	O
fast	O
and	O
all	O
together	O
:)	O
i	O
like	O
that...	O
i	O
hate	O
the	O
pretentiousness	O
of	O
things	O
coming	O
in	O
one	O
after	O
the	O
other.	O

so	O
about	O
the	O
prawns	B-A
,	O
they	O
were	O
fresh	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
slight	O
crispiness	O
about	O
the	O
batter	B-A
...	O
soooo	O
good...	O
the	O
walnuts	B-A
	O
were	O
cut	O
in	O
smaller	O
pieces	O
and	O
very	O
crunchy	O
and	O
tasty.	O

yummy.	O

best	O
honey	B-A
walnyt	I-A
prawns	I-A
	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
every	O
tasted.	O

next	O
one	O
that	O
we	O
ordered	O
were	O
prawns	O
and	O
scallop	O
with	O
brocolli.	O

the	O
brocollis	B-A
	O
were	O
so	O
fresh	O
and	O
tasty.	O

i	O
would	O
normally	O
not	O
finish	O
the	O
brocolli	B-A
	O
when	O
i	O
order	O
these	O
kinds	O
of	O
food	O
but	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time,	O
every	O
piece	O
was	O
as	O
eventful	O
as	O
the	O
first	O
one...	O
the	O
scallops	B-A
	O
and	O
prawns	B-A
	O
was	O
so	O
fresh	O
and	O
nicely	O
cooked.	O

not	O
chewy	O
at	O
all.	O

for	O

we	O
had	O

...	O
oh	O
la	O
la	O
yummy!!!	O

melt	O
in	O
your	O
mouth.	O

we	O
are	O
for	O
sure	O
coming	O
back	O
to	O
this	O
restaurant	B-A
.	O

every	O
month	O
if	O
possible.	O

it	O
is	O
sad	O
there	O
is	O
not	O
many	O
people	O
who	O
frequent	O
eating	O
at	O
places	O
like	O
these	O
that	O
look	O
pricey	O
because	O
they	O
are	O
at	O
the	O
hotel...	O
but	O
they	O
are	O
definitely	O
one	O
you	O
dont	O
want	O
to	O
miss,	O
esp	O
if	O
your	O
in	O
downtown	O
san	O

Chintzy	O
portions	B-A
	O

–	O
The	O
sushi	B-A
	O
here	O
is	O
perfectly	O
good,	O
but	O
for	O
$5	O
a	O
piece,	O
either	O
the	O
slices	O
of	O
fish	O
should	O
be	O
larger,	O
or	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
no	O
pretense	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
moderately	O
priced	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
(even	O
for	O
NYC).	O

We	O
easily	O
spent	O
more	O
than	O
$40	O
per	O
person	O
(not	O
including	O
alcohol)	O
and	O
were	O
still	O
hungry.	O

I'm	O
astonished	O
that	O
this	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
is	O
categorized	O
as	O
$$$	O
rather	O
than	O
$$$$.	O

Terrible	O
service	B-A
,	O
food	B-A
	O
ok,	O
pricey	O

–	O
This	O
past	O
weekend	O
had	O
great	O
weather	O
for	O
San	O
Francisco	O
standards.	O

So	O
for	O
the	O
'after	O
beach	O
excursion',	O
we	O
thought	O
we	O
would	O
end	O
the	O
day	O
on	O
a	O
high	O
note	O
and	O
make	O
the	O
trip	O
across	O
the	O
street	O
from	O
the	O
beach	O
to	O
Park	O
Chalet.	O

The	O
restaurant	O
was	O
busy,	O
however	O
there	O
were	O
a	O
few	O
tables	O
open.	O

We	O
put	O
out	O
name	O
down	O
and	O
although	O
there	O
were	O
open	O
tables	O
we	O
were	O
told	O
that	O
it'd	O
be	O
a	O
30	O
minute	O
wait.	O

So	O
here	O
we	O
are,	O
my	O
wife,	O
3	O
year	O
old	O
daughter	O
and	O
I	O
trying	O
to	O
pass	O
the	O
time	O
by	O
hanging	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
front	O
of	O
the	O
building	O
(where	O
the	O
murals	O
and	O
artifacts	O
are).	O

30	O
minutes	O
went	O
by	O
and	O
sure	O
enough	O
the	O
pager	O
buzzer	O
went	O
off.	O

We	O
went	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
restaurant	O
and	O
low	O
and	O
behold,	O
we	O
were	O
seated	O
at	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
tables	O
that	O
was	O
available	O
30	O
minutes	O
ago!!	O

Logic	O
behind	O
that?	O

None	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
think	O
of.	O

We	O
put	O
in	O
our	O
order	O
and	O
although	O
we	O
ordered	O
4	O
appetizers,	O
the	O
food	O
didn't	O
arrive	O
until	O
45	O
minutes	O
later...WITH	O
OUR	O
MAIN	O
COURSE.	O

Um	O
so	O
now	O
what	O
are	O
appetizers	O
for???	O

Oh	O
I	O
forgot	O
to	O
mention	O
that	O
they	O
don't	O
have	O
bread	O
service.	O

Its	O
a	O
good	O
thing	O
my	O
daughter	O
had	O
some	O
snacks	O
in	O
her	O
lunch	O
bag.	O

My	O
wife	O
also	O
ordered	O
a	O
teapot	O
of	O
hot	O
water	O
(she	O
had	O
a	O
sore	O
throat)	O
and	O
I	O
guess	O
that	O
since	O
it	O
was	O
only	O
water,	O
it	O
wasn't	O
a	O
priority	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
actually	O
bring	O
it.	O

In	O
other	O
words,	O
if	O
they	O
aren't	O
making	O
$$	O
off	O
of	O
you	O
then	O
you	O
don't	O
rate	O
high	O
on	O
their	O
'service	B-A
	O
scale'.	O

Food	B-A
	O
wise,	O
its	O
ok	O
but	O
a	O
bit	O
pricey	O
for	O
what	O
you	O
get	O
considering	O
the	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
isn't	O
a	O
fancy	O
place.	O

The	O
upside	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant?	O

If	O
I	O
needed	O
to	O
name	O
some	O
they	O
would	O
include	O
the	O
location	B-A
	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O
or	O
Golden	O
Gate	O
park.	O

Its	O
great	O
if	O
you	O
spent	O
the	O
day	O
there	O
and	O
didn't	O
want	O
to	O
drive	O
to	O
eat.	O

Parking	O
is	O
reasonably	O
good,	O
they	O
have	O
their	O
own	O
lot	O
and	O
you	O
can	O
park	O
in	O
the	O
park	O
nearby.	O

Another	O
plus	O
is	O
the	O
open	O
feel	B-A
	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	O
with	O
glass	B-A
walls	I-A
	O
on	O
all	O
sides.	O

I'd	O
hate	O
for	O
tourists	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Park	O
Chalet	O
and	O
think	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
how	O
all	O
San	O
Francisco	O
restaurants	O
are	O
like.	O

Always	O
good.	O

–	O
A	O

As	O

didn't	O
disappoint	O
in	O
freshness,	O
although	O
it	O
scored	O

and	O

Their	O

While	O
this	O
diner	O
had	O
reasonably	O
good	O
food	B-A
,	O
the	O
restaurant	B-A
staff	I-A
	O
seemed	O
completely	O
indifferent	O
to	O
our	O
presence,	O
and	O
this	O
attitude	O
was	O
reflected	O
in	O
the	O
lack	O
of	O
service.	O

As	O
part	O
of	O
a	O
small	O
party	O
of	O
four,	O
our	O
food	O
was	O
dropped	O
off	O
without	O
comment;	O

any	O
further	O
needs	O
we	O
may	O
have	O
had	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
met	O
since	O
no	O
one	O
stopped	O
by	O
the	O
table.	O

When	O
we	O
finally	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
flag	O
someone	O
down,	O
it	O
was	O
someone	O
entirely	O
different	O
from	O
the	O
person	O
who	O
had	O
dropped	O
off	O
the	O
food,	O
who	O
was	O
also	O
not	O
the	O
same	O
person	O
who	O
had	O
taken	O
our	O
order.	O

After	O
one	O
member	O
of	O
our	O
party	O
had	O
been	O
bumped	O
repeatedly	O
by	O
a	O
waitress	B-A
,	O
a	O
polite	O
request	O
that	O
he	O
not	O
be	O
bumped	O
sent	O
the	O
waitress	O
into	O
an	O
abusive	O
rant.	O

A	O
brief	O
conversation	O
with	O
the	O
manager	B-A
	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
meal	O
was	O
the	O
greatest	O
disappointment--to	O
say	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
"blown	O
off"	O
would	O
be	O
an	O
understatement.	O

The	O
manager	B-A
	O
continually	O
interrupted	O
with	O
"Is	O
there	O
anything	O
else	O
I	O
can	O
do	O
for	O
you?",	O
a	O
strange	O
comment	O
because	O
she	O
had	O
hardly	O
listened,	O
let	O
alone	O
responded	O
to	O
our	O
expression	O
of	O
disappointment	O
at	O
our	O
experience.	O

She	O
promised	O
to	O
speak	O
to	O
the	O
waitress	O
who	O
had	O
flown	O
off	O
in	O
a	O
rage,	O
but	O
we	O
could	O
hardly	O
take	O
her	O
promise	O
seriously,	O
seeing	O
as	O
she	O
hadn't	O
bothered	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
waitresses	O
name.	O

In	O
short,	O
Schooner	O
or	O
Later	O
couldn't	O
have	O
cared	O
less	O
about	O
our	O
being	O
at	O
their	O

Next	O
time	O
we	O
will	O
go	O
somewhere	O

I	O
decided	O
to	O
eat	O
at	O
Stack	O
because	O
of	O
their	O
price	B-A
fixed	I-A
pre-show	I-A
dinner	I-A
.	O

When	O
I	O
walked	O
in,	O
I	O
was	O
taken	O
aback	O
by	O
their	O
incredible	O
wood	B-A
decor	I-A
.	O

The	O
music	B-A
	O
playing	O
was	O
very	O
hip,	O
20-30	O
something	O
pop	O
music,	O
but	O
the	O
subwoofer	B-A
to	I-A
the	I-A
sound	I-A
system	I-A
	O
was	O
located	O
under	O
my	O
seat,	O
which	O
became	O
annoying	O
midway	O
through	O
dinner.	O

We	O
were	O
quickly	O
seated	O
and	O
requested	O
the	O
special	O
dinner,	O
which	O
came	O
with:	O
1)	O
Shellfish	O
and	O
Shrimp	O
appetizer	O
or	O
Caesar	O
Salad,	O
2)	O
9	O
oz	O
steak	O
(with	O
a	O
single	O
potato	O
chip),	O
and	O
3)	O
homemade	O
donut	O
holes.	O

I	O
got	O
the	O
shellfish	B-A
and	I-A
shrimp	I-A
appetizer	I-A
	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
alright.	O

It	O
wasn't	O
the	O
freshest	O
seafood	B-A
	O
ever,	O
but	O
the	O
taste	O
and	O
presentation	O
was	O
OK.	O

Before	O
the	O
steak	O
came,	O
the	O
server	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
the	O
steak	O
did	O
not	O
come	O
with	O
any	O
sides	O
and	O
suggested	O
I	O
pick	O
something	O
from	O
the	O
menu.	O

I	O
picked	O
the	O
asparagus	B-A
,	O
which	O
turned	O
out	O
to	O
be	O
incredible	O
and	O
perfectly	O
prepared.	O

It	O
was	O
steamed	O
and	O
tossed	O
with	O
garlic.	O

The	O
9	B-A
oz	I-A
steak	I-A
	O
came	O
next	O
and	O
it	O
tasted	O
great,	O
at	O
least	O
initially.	O

The	O
steak	B-A
	O
was	O
done	O
to	O
my	O
exact	O
liking	O
(medium	O
rare)	O
and	O
was	O
nice	O
and	O
juicy.	O

It?s	O
served	O
with	O
either	O
a	O
peppercorn	B-A
sauce	I-A
	O
or	O
red	B-A
wine	I-A
reduction	I-A
,	O
though	O
both	O
were	O
indistinguishable	O
in	O
taste.	O

Though,	O
one	O
thing	O
I	O
realized	O
later	O
on	O
was	O
that	O
the	O
restaurant	O
either	O
used	O
MSG	O
or	O
a	O
meat	O
tenderizer	O
on	O
the	O
steak	B-A
.	O

My	O
mouth	O
felt	O
very	O
dry	O
afterwards	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
that	O
signature	O
?MSG?	O
taste	O
lingering	O
in	O
my	O
throat	O
after	O
I	O
left	O
the	O
restaurant.	O

Finally,	O
the	O
homemade	O
donut	O
holes	O
were	O
served	O
for	O
desert.	O

They	O
came	O
in	O
their	O
own	O
nifty	O
take	O
out	O
box	O
and	O
with	O
some	O
homemade	O
frosting;	O
very	O
light	O
and	O
not-too-sweet.	O

The	O
desert	B-A
	O
was	O
the	O
perfect	O
ending	O
to	O
an	O
almost	O
perfect	O
dinner	B-A
.	O

The	O
dinner	O
only	O
took	O
us	O
about	O
an	O
hour	O
and	O
the	O
prices	O
were	O
alright	O
for	O
the	O
strip,	O
almost	O
$50/pp	O
after	O
tax	O
and	O
tip	O
(about	O
average).	O

But	O
the	O
servers	B-A
	O
were	O
extremely	O
attentive	O
and	O
very	O
friendly.	O

Overall,	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
back	O
and	O
eat	O
at	O
the	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
again.	O

Just	O
remember	O
to	O
dress	O
a	O
little	O
urban-chic	O
so	O
you	O
don?t	O
look	O
too	O
far	O
out	O
of	O

	O
made	O
several	O

	O
suggestions	O
which	O
were	O
very	O
good.	O

had	O

the	O

was	O

VERY	O

Overpriced	O

–	O
We	O
dined	O
at	O
the	O
Colorado	O
location	O
today.	O

Waited	O
35	O
minutes	O
for	O
a	O
table	O
for	O
8	O
which	O
was	O
ok	O
for	O
such	O
a	O
big	O
crowd.	O

The	O
waiter	B-A
	O
was	O
a	O
bit	O
unfriendly	O
and	O
the	O
feel	B-A
	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	O
was	O
crowded.	O

Also,	O
there	O
was	O
only	O
one	O
bathroom	B-A
stall	I-A
-	O
probably	O
need	O
more	O
for	O
such	O
big	O
crowds.	O

Most	O
importantly,	O
we	O
were	O
so	O
excited	O
about	O
the	O
food	O
after	O
seeing	O
the	O
very	O
creative	O
menu	B-A
.	O

At	O
best,	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
good	O
and	O
definately	O
overpriced.	O

For	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
food	B-A
	O
we	O
got	O
the	O
prices	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
lower.	O

Not	O

I	O
would	O
go	O

but	O
everytime	O
I've	O
been	O
there	O
they	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
busy,	O
which	O
probably	O
accounts	O
for	O
the	O

of	O

the	O

was	O

It's	O

–	O
I	O
didn't	O
want	O
to	O
go	O
there	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
reviews	O
and	O
prices	O
I	O
saw	O
on	O
the	O
internet.	O

That	O
was	O
the	O
last	O
night	O
in	O
Vegas	O
and	O
was	O
too	O
late	O
and	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	O
were	O
closing	O
-	O
so	O
we	O
walked	O
in	O
the	O
check	O
the	O
place.	O

We	O
were	O
seated	O
right	O
away,	O
the	O
table	B-A
	O
was	O
private	O
and	O
nice.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
exceptional	O
-	O
sometime	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
feeling	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
served	O
by	O
the	O
army	O
of	O

waiters	B-A
.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
good,	O
filet	B-A

	O
was	O
probably	O
the	O
best	O
I've	O
ever	O
try.	O

The	O
portions	B-A
	O
are	O
big	O
though,	O
so	O
do	O
not	O
order	O
too	O
much.	O

Groovy	O
music	B-A
	O
made	O
the	O
dinner	O
casual.	O

The	O
most	O
pleasant	O
surprise	O
was	O
the	O
check	O
that	O
did	O
not	O
exceed	O
my	O

as	O
it	O
always	O

in	O

a	O

with	O
two	O

the	O

I	O

for	O
it	O

chance	O
to	O

at	O
this	O

as	O
the	O

The	O
presentation	O
of	O
Snooze	B-A
	O
is	O

and	O
it	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
places	O
that	O
you	O
feel	O
more	O
sophisticated	O
just	O
for	O
being	O
there;	O
but	O
peel	O
back	O
the	O
layers	O
and	O
you	O
have	O
an	O
overpriced	O
IHOP	O
with	O
a	O
high	O
brow	O
menu	B-A
.	O

To	O
start	O
off,	O
approximately	O
8-10	O
oz	O
of	O
orange	B-A
juice	I-A
	O
will	O
cost	O
you	O
$3.	O

They	O
serve	O
it	O
in	O
a	O
tall,	O
skinny	O
hour-glass	O
shaped	O
glass	O
to	O
disguise	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
you	O
a	O
getting	O
a	O
small	O
juice	B-A
	O
at	O
the	O
price	O
of	O
a	O
half	O
gallon	O
in	O
a	O
supermarket.	O

I	O
should	O
have	O
just	O
asked	O
for	O
the	O
check	O
when	O
I	O
saw	O
that;	O
but	O
their	O
menu	B-A
	O
was	O
so	O
unique	O
that	O
I	O
continued.	O

The	O
pancakes	B-A
	O
were	O
certainly	O
inventive	O
but	O
$8.50	O
for	O
3	O
-	O
6"	O
pancakes	O
(one	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
more	O
like	O
5")	O
in	O
the	O
pancake	O
flight	O
(sample	O
of	O
3	O
different	O
pancakes)	O
is	O
well	O
over-priced.	O

The	O
pancakes	B-A
	O
should	O
be	O
larger	O
(at	O
least	O
8")	O
to	O
justify	O
the	O
expense	O
even	O
with	O
the	O
unique	O
offerings.	O

The	O
flavors	O
were	O
good	O
but	O
I	O
have	O
had	O
far	O
better	O
pancakes	O
at	O
a	O
German	O
pancake	O
specialty	O
restaurant	O
that	O
were	O
a	O
little	O
cheaper	O
but	O
significantly	O
larger.	O

On	O
my	O
meal	B-A
	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
send	O
back	O
my	O
eggs	B-A
	O
for	O
a	O
simple	O
request	O
of	O
breaking	O
the	O
yokes	O
before	O
cooking,	O
and	O
would	O
have	O
had	O
to	O
send	O
them	O
back	O
again	O
if	O
I	O
hadn't	O
rejected	O
the	O
meal	O
all	O
together.	O

I	O
rejected	O
it	O
because	O
in	O
the	O
process	O
of	O
attempting	O
to	O
fix	O
the	O
eggs	O
they	O
broke	O
something	O
else	O
in	O
the	O
dish	B-A
	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
too	O
frustrated	O
to	O
continue.	O

To	O
their	O
credit	O
they	O
removed	O
the	O
dish	O
from	O
the	O
check;	O
but	O
no	O
manager	B-A
	O
stopped	O
by	O
to	O
ask	O
what	O
the	O
problem	O
was.	O

In	O
the	O
end	O
our	O
check	O
came	O
to	O
$27	O
for	O
4	O

at	O
Ray's	B-A
Boathouse	I-A
	O
last	O

completely	O
exceeded	O
my	O

Ray's	O

something	O

a	O
Seattle	O
institution,	O
but	O
given	O
its	O
gorgeous	O
Sound	B-A

I	O
had	O
suspected	O
that	O
the	O

were	O
more	O
due	O
to	O
the	O

than	O
to	O
the	O

Imagine	O
my	O

upon	O
finding	O
that	O
the	O

only	O
the	O

the	O
night,	O
but	O
I	O
did	O
remain	O
puzzled	O
by	O
one	O
issue:	O
	O
Who	O
thinks	O
that	O
Ray's	B-A
	O
is	O
an	O
appropriate	O
place	O
to	O
take	O
young	O
children	O
for	O
dinner?	O

Two	O
rascally	O
kids	O
were	O
seated	O
near	O
us	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
part	O
of	O
our	O
dinner...they	O
were	O
replaced	O
by	O
a	O
delightful	O
preteen	O
who	O
pretended	O
to	O
gag	O
every	O
time	O
seafood	O
was	O
mentioned	O
at	O
her	O
table.	O

Given	O
that	O
Ray's	O
is	O
a	O
seafood	O
restaurant...well,	O
you	O
get	O
the	O
idea...	O

All	O
considered,	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
Ray's	B-A
Boathouse	I-A
	O
is	O
deserving	O
of	O
its	O
title	O
as	O
a	O
Seattle	O
institution.	O

While	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
done	O
without	O
the	O
youth	O
who	O
shared	O
the	O
evening	O
with	O
us,	O
our	O
wonderful	O
server	B-A
	O
and	O
food	B-A
	O
made	O
the	O
experience	O
a	O
very	O
positive	O
one.	O

Oh	O
yeah...the	O
view	B-A
	O
was	O
good,	O
too.	O
