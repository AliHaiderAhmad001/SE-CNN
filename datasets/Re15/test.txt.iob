Had	O
no	O
flavor	O

the	O

The	O

the	O

I	O

I	O

I	O
showed	O
it	O

us	O
two	O

did	O

When	O
the	O

nothing	O

I	O

that	O
we	O
were	O

a	O

I	O

made	O
it	O

most	O
of	O
the	O
dishes	B-A
I	O
have	O
to	O
agree	O
with	O
a	O

My	O

to	O
this	O

even	O
she	O
being	O
Indian	O
feels	O
the	O
food	B-A
can	O
be	O
somewhat	O
over	O
the	O
top	O
spicy	O
and	O
far	O
too	O
oily	O

Still	O
we	O
keep	O
going	O

I	O
was	O
speechless	O
by	O
the	O
horrible	O
food	B-A

I	O
attended	O
a	O
holiday	O
dinner	O
at	O
the	O
restaurant	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
was	O
majorly	O
disappointing	O

Rather	O
than	O
eating	O
the	O
meat	O
entree	O
being	O
offered	O
,	O
I	O
requested	O
a	O
vegetarian	O
dish	O

Rather	O
than	O
preparing	O
vegetarian	B-A
dish	I-A
the	O
chef	B-A
presented	O
me	O
with	O
a	O
plate	O
of	O
steamed	O
vegetables	O
minus	O
sauce	O
,	O
seasoning	O
,	O
or	O
any	O

I	O
was	O
so	O

and	O
I	O
left	O
the	O
dinner	O
hungry	O
and	O
majorly	O

they	O

What	O

I	O
read	O

that	O
called	O
the	O

too	O
expensive	O
and	O
I	O
thought	O

The	B-A
Four	I-A
Seasons	I-A
has	O
history	O

it	O
is	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
landmark	O
of	O
New	O
York	O
City	O
restaurants	O
,	O
but	O
trust	O
me	O
,	O
they	O
will	O
charge	O
you	O
through	O
the	O
nose	O
just	O
so	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
say	O
Ive	O
been	O
to	O
the	O
four	O
seasons	O
restaurant	O

I	O
wanted	O
to	O
go	O
there	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
worth	O
it	O
and	O
sadly	O
,	O
curiousity	O
got	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
me	O
and	O
I	O
paid	O
dearly	O
for	O
it	O

All	O
in	O
all	O
,	O
the	O
food	B-A
was	O
great	O
except	O
for	O
the	O
dessserts	B-A

The	O
environment	B-A
is	O
very	O
upscale	O
and	O
you	O
will	O
see	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
rich	O
guys	O
with	O
trophy	O
wives	O
or	O
just	O
highly	O
paid	O
escorts	O

If	O
you	O
are	O
going	O
for	O
the	O
food	B-A
it	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
worth	O
it	O

Yes	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
good	O
,	O
but	O
Ive	O
had	O
better	O
for	O
cheaper	O

You	O
would	O
think	O
they	O
would	O
make	O
up	O
for	O
it	O
with	O
service	B-A
sadly	O
,	O
no	O

Service	B-A
was	O
just	O
ok	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
what	O
youd	O
expect	O
for	O
500	O

Terrible	O
Waste	O
of	O
money	O

I	O
agree	O
that	O
dining	O
at	O
Casa	B-A
La	I-A
Femme	I-A
is	O
like	O
no	O
other	O
dining	O
experience	O

BUT	O
not	O
in	O
a	O
good	O
way	O

I	O
am	O
actually	O
offended	O
to	O
have	O
spent	O
so	O
much	O
money	O
on	O
such	O
a	O
bad	O
experience	O

I	O
literally	O
just	O
got	O
back	O
home	O
after	O
visiting	O
Casa	B-A
La	I-A
Femme	I-A
and	O
was	O
so	O
offended	O
by	O
my	O
visit	O
felt	O
it	O
necessary	O
to	O
try	O
and	O
warn	O
other	O
diners	O
who	O
value	O
their	O
money	O
and	O
time	O

We	O
went	O
to	O
celebrate	O
two	O
birthdays	O
and	O
wanted	O
to	O
do	O
something	O
special	O
and	O
different	O

Our	O
visit	O
their	O
to	O
say	O
the	O
least	O
,	O
was	O
an	O
unpleasant	O
and	O
costly	O
experience	O

And	O
even	O
more	O
so	O
unpleasant	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
costly	O
for	O
such	O
an	O
unpleasant	O
experience	O

We	O
did	O
arrive	O
late	O
for	O
our	O
reservation	O
so	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
complain	O
too	O
much	O
about	O
the	O
wait	B-A
for	O
a	O
table	O

Although	O
we	O
were	O
told	O
1015	O
minutes	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
more	O
like	O
45	O
minutes	O

We	O
were	O
ushered	O
to	O
the	O
bar	O
to	O
wait	O
momentarily	O
and	O
upon	O
arrival	O
were	O
so	O
excited	O

The	O
place	B-A
is	O
beautiful	O

The	O
hostess	B-A
was	O
very	O
pleasant	O

However	O
,	O
our	O
14	O
drinks	B-A
were	O
were	O
horrible	O

Once	O
we	O
finally	O
got	O
a	O
table	O
,	O
despite	O
indicating	O
we	O
wanted	O
an	O
alla	O
carte	O
menu	O
we	O
were	O
pushed	O
into	O
a	O
table	O
that	O
was	O
only	O
price	O
fixed	O

Since	O
we	O
were	O
already	O
waiting	O
so	O
long	O
,	O
we	O
felt	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
other	O
choice	O
but	O
to	O
accept	O
it	O

Our	O
experience	O
did	O
not	O
ever	O
get	O
any	O
better	O

For	O
each	O
course	O
we	O
waited	O
over	O
12	O
hour	O
to	O
45	O
minutes	O
and	O
were	O
never	O
offered	O
a	O
drink	O

We	O
also	O
asked	O
for	O
Hooka	O
six	O
times	O
and	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
kept	O
telling	O
us	O
one	O
minute	O
and	O
never	O
returning	O
with	O
the	O
Hooka	O

After	O
the	O
4th	O
time	O
i	O
asked	O
again	O
and	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
than	O
said	O
after	O
our	O
dinner	O

We	O
asked	O
for	O
beverages	O
and	O
never	O
received	O
them	O

We	O
asked	O
for	O
sides	O
which	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
than	O
admitted	O
that	O
he	O
forgot	O
to	O
put	O
in	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
our	O
order	O

My	O
chicken	B-A
was	O
inedible	O
as	O
there	O
were	O
so	O
many	O
fatty	O
lumps	O
which	O
i	O
had	O
to	O
keep	O
spitting	O
out	O
into	O
my	O
napkin	O

I	O
would	O
not	O
expect	O
this	O
for	O
a	O
55	O
dinner	B-A

By	O
the	O
time	O
we	O
finished	O
our	O
dinner	O
we	O
still	O
had	O
not	O
received	O
one	O
beverage	O
NOR	O
hooka	O

What	O
we	O
did	O
do	O
was	O
waste	O
3	O
hours	O
being	O
trapped	O
in	O
a	O
table	O
waiting	O
and	O
waiting	O
for	O
food	O
and	O
drinks	O
and	O
hooka	O
some	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
never	O
received	O

The	O
only	O
beverage	O
we	O
did	O
receive	O
was	O
water	O
in	O
dirty	O
glasses	O

To	O
top	O
it	O
all	O
off	O
the	O
main	O
reason	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
your	O
restaurant	O
was	O
for	O
the	O
belly	O
dancers	O
and	O
missed	O
the	O
first	O
show	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
seated	O
yet	O
and	O
the	O
2nd	O
belly	O
dancer	O
only	O
danced	O
at	O
two	O
tables	O
in	O
the	O
back	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	O
and	O
never	O
made	O
it	O
around	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
half	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	O

By	O
the	O
time	O
we	O
left	O
our	O
wallets	O
were	O
empy	O
and	O
so	O
were	O
our	O
stomachs	O
AND	O
we	O
missed	O
the	O
show	O
we	O
were	O
supposed	O
to	O
see	O
following	O
our	O
dinner	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
acceptable	O
if	O
we	O
got	O
to	O
enjoy	O
the	O
experience	O
of	O
good	O
food	B-A
and	O
belly	O
dancers	O

If	O
it	O
seemed	O
possible	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
while	O
there	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
fought	O
my	O
bill	O
since	O
my	O
dinner	O
portion	O
of	O
my	O
meal	B-A
was	O
inedible	O

I	O
have	O
never	O
left	O
a	O

feeling	O
as	O
if	O
i	O
was	O
abused	O
,	O
and	O
wasted	O
my	O
hard	O

thats	O
a	O
large	O
group	O
,	O
unless	O
you	O
arent	O
together	O
,	O
to	O
which	O
I	O
replied	O
no	O
we	O
are	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
will	O
be	O
one	O
more	O
,	O
so	O
a	O
table	O
for	O
six	O
please	O

At	O
first	O
we	O
were	O
a	O
little	O
taken	O
aback	O
,	O
as	O
this	O
seemed	O
to	O
present	O
a	O
problem	O
,	O
although	O
the	O
restaurant	O
looked	O
fairly	O
empty	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
hastily	O
put	O
the	O
table	O
together	O
for	O
us	O

The	O
menu	B-A
is	O
fairly	O
simple	O
without	O
much	O
descriptions	O

There	O
was	O
no	O
tap	O
beer	B-A
that	O
evening	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
disappointment	O

Not	O
much	O
of	O
a	O
selection	B-A
of	I-A
bottled	I-A
beer	I-A
either	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
with	O
Brahma	O

The	O
appetizers	O
we	O
ordered	O
were	O
served	O
quickly	O
an	O
order	O
of	O
fried	B-A
oysters	I-A
and	I-A
clams	I-A
were	O
delicious	O
but	O
a	O
tiny	O
portion	O
maybe	O
3	O
of	O
each	O

The	O
lobster	B-A
knuckles	I-A
special	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
were	O
ok	O
,	O
but	O
pretty	O
tasteless	O

I	O
believe	O
there	O
were	O
2	O
shrimp	O
in	O
the	O
salt	B-A
encrusted	I-A
shrimp	I-A
appetizer	I-A

After	O
we	O
ate	O
our	O
appetizers	O
which	O
took	O
all	O
of	O
8	O
minutes	O
we	O
ordered	O
another	O
round	O
of	O
Brahmas	O
and	O
tried	O
to	O
stall	O
a	O
little	O
as	O
we	O
waited	O
for	O
our	O
sixth	O
dinner	O
member	O

The	O
waitress	O
appeared	O
and	O
asked	O
us	O
if	O
we	O
wanted	O
to	O
go	O
ahead	O
and	O
order	O

We	O
replied	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
wait	O
5	O
more	O
minutes	O
if	O
that	O
was	O
okay	O

She	O
replied	O
well	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
convenient	O
for	O
us	O
if	O
you	O
ordered	O
now	O
,	O
since	O
you	O
are	O
a	O
larger	O
party	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
might	O
get	O
crowded	O

We	O
called	O
the	O
other	O
person	O
who	O
was	O
very	O
close	O
by	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
told	O
us	O
to	O
order	O
for	O
her	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
did	O

The	O
food	O
arrived	O
in	O
about	O
15	O
minutes	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
Thai	B-A
style	I-A
Fried	I-A
Sea	I-A
Bass	I-A
which	O
was	O
very	O
good	O

Everyone	O
seemed	O
generally	O
happy	O
with	O
their	O
food	B-A
except	O
my	O
brother	O
who	O
had	O
the	O
grilled	B-A
Mahi	I-A
Mahi	I-A
seemingly	O
drenched	O
in	O
Grapfruit	O
Juice	O

I	O
heard	O
the	O
lobster	B-A
roll	I-A
was	O
excellent	O

They	O
seemed	O
to	O
continue	O
to	O
rush	O
us	O
along	O
,	O
taking	O
plates	O
without	O
asking	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
done	O
my	O
sister	O
still	O
had	O
her	O
fork	O
in	O
hand	O

All	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
food	B-A
was	O
good	O
a	O
little	O
on	O
the	O
expensive	O
side	O
,	O
but	O
fresh	O

Service	B-A
not	O
the	O
friendliest	O
to	O
our	O
large	O
party	O

Probably	O
would	O
not	O
go	O
back	O
here	O

Great	O
Indian	B-A
food	I-A

I	O
lived	O
on	O
50th	O
st	O
,	O
and	O
wanted	O
Indian	O
one	O
day	O
so	O
decided	O
to	O
check	O
this	O
place	O
out	O

Food	B-A
was	O
amazing	O
I	O
love	O
Indian	O
food	O
and	O
eat	O
it	O
quite	O
regularly	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
this	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
Ive	O
had	O

Very	O
normal	O
Indian	B-A
food	I-A
but	O
done	O
really	O
well	O

I	O
have	O
it	O
a	O
4	O
instead	O
of	O
5	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
price	O
just	O
chicken	B-A
tikka	I-A
masala	I-A
no	O
bread	O
of	O
rice	O
is	O
25	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
would	O
expect	O
at	O
a	O
upscale	O
Indian	O
restaurant	O
but	O
this	O
place	B-A
doesnt	O
have	O
an	O
upscale	O
feel	B-A

Also	O
,	O
waiters	B-A
try	O
to	O
push	O
more	O
food	O
on	O
you	O
,	O
like	O
suggest	O
things	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
are	O
complimentary	O
when	O
they	O
actually	O
cost	O

I	O
dont	O
appreciate	O
places	O
or	O
people	O
that	O
try	O
to	O
drive	O
up	O
the	O
bill	O
without	O
the	O
patrons	O
knowledge	O
so	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
huge	O
turnoff	O
more	O
than	O
the	O
price	O

But	O
if	O
youre	O
prepared	O
to	O
spend	O
some	O
and	O
remember	O
to	O
ask	O
if	O
something	O
they	O
offer	O
is	O
complimentary	O
,	O
then	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
place	B-A
to	O
go	O
for	O
Indian	B-A

This	O
will	O

the	O

online	O
review	O
I	O
have	O

about	O
a	O

They	O
have	O
all	O
been	O
tonight	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
all	O
been	O
about	O
the	O

I	O
have	O
never	O
been	O
so	O
disgusted	O
by	O
both	O
food	B-A
an	O

For	O

I	O

once	O
I	O

my	O
predictably	O
mediocre	O
order	O
of	O
what	O
Dokebi	O
thinks	O
passes	O
as	O
Korean	B-A
fair	I-A
sometimes	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
settle	O
when	O
its	O
your	O
only	O
option	O
,	O
I	O
got	O
through	O
about	O
half	O
my	O
kimchee	B-A
before	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O

accompanied	O
by	O
a	O
far	O
more	O
disgusting	O
,	O

clearly	O

piece	O

Not	O
one	O
to	O
jump	O
to	O
complaints	O
hence	O
my	O
lack	O
of	O
previous	O
online	O
reviewing	O
,	O
I	O
called	O
the	O
restaurant	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
a	O
heads	O
up	O
that	O
their	O
kitchen	O
might	O
want	O
to	O
check	O
the	O
cleanliness	O
of	O
their	O
prep	O
stations	O

My	O
main	O
concern	O
was	O
the	O
sanity	O
of	O
the	O
food	B-A
that	O
was	O
being	O
sent	O
out	O
to	O
myself	O
and	O
others	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
lying	O
is	O
I	O
said	O
that	O
as	O
someone	O
who	O
has	O
worked	O
in	O
restaurants	O
since	O
the	O
age	O
of	O
fifteen	O
I	O
was	O
expecting	O
at	O
least	O
a	O
minimal	O
effort	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	O
to	O
amend	O
the	O
situation	O

None	O
was	O
made	O
so	O
i	O
hung	O
up	O

Less	O
than	O
three	O
minutes	O
passed	O
before	O
I	O
found	O
myself	O
doubled	O
over	O

My	O
girlfriend	O
,	O
being	O
slightly	O
more	O
aggressive	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
been	O
equally	O
disgusted	O
causing	O
her	O
to	O
throw	O
out	O
the	O
remainder	O
of	O
her	O
barely	O
eaten	O
meal	B-A
called	O
back	O
only	O
to	O
be	O
informed	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
probably	O
wrong	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
most	O
likely	O
an	O
oyster	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
also	O
blacklisted	O
from	O
their	O
restaurant	O

Not	O
only	O
have	O
I	O
worked	O

and	O
my	O

half	O
Korean	O

We	O
know	O
the	O
difference	O
between	O
and	O
oyster	O
and	O
bad	O
fish	O

It	O
wasnt	O
as	O
if	O
this	O
restaurant	B-A
had	O
any	O

which	O
we	O
enjoyed	O
a	O

The	O

as	O
the	O

knew	O
everything	O
about	O
the	O
menu	O
and	O
his	O

My	O
wife	O
and	O
I	O
visited	O
Dokebi	O
tonight	O

We	O
ordered	O
dosut	O
bibimbap	O
and	O
nakgibokum	O

The	O
dishes	O
came	O
out	O
around	O
5	O
minutes	O
apart	O

The	O
bibimbap	B-A
was	O
average	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
stone	B-A
bowl	I-A
wasnt	O
even	O
close	O
to	O
sizzling	O

Too	O
bad	O
I	O
had	O
paid	O
an	O
extra	O
2	O
for	O
the	O
stone	B-A
bowl	I-A

The	O
nakgibokum	B-A
was	O
horrible	O

Easily	O
the	O
worst	O
stirfried	B-A
squid	I-A
Ive	O
ever	O
tasted	O

The	O
sauce	B-A
tasted	O
more	O
like	O
Chinese	O
fast	O
food	O
than	O
decent	O
Korean	O

The	O
side	B-A
dishes	I-A
were	O
passable	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
did	O
get	O
a	O
refill	O
upon	O
request	O

The	O
real	O
problem	O
I	O
had	O
with	O
this	O
place	O
was	O
the	O
complete	O
lack	O
of	O
service	B-A

I	O
mentioned	O
the	O
squid	O
dish	O
wasnt	O
very	O
good	O
when	O
the	O
waitress	O
visited	O

She	O
just	O
nodded	O
and	O
walked	O
off	O

There	O
were	O
no	O
communications	O

either	O

as	O
she	O
spoke	O

As	O
to	O
my	O

about	O
the	O
food	O
,	O
no	O
apology	O

My	O

The	O

a	O
fan	O
of	O
sakes	O
but	O
am	O
lately	O
experimenting	O
with	O
it	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
and	O
am	O
acquiring	O
a	O
better	O
taste	O
of	O
it	O

We	O
started	O
off	O
with	O
a	O
delightful	O
sashimi	B-A
amuse	I-A
bouche	I-A

Our	O
first	O
course	O
was	O
Tuna	O
Sashimi	O
with	O
Green	O
Yuzu	O
Sauce	O

I	O
picked	O
the	O
Grilled	B-A
Black	I-A
Cod	I-A
as	O
my	O
entree	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
absolutely	O
devoured	O
while	O
someone	O
commented	O
that	O
the	O
Grilled	B-A
Salmon	I-A
dish	I-A
was	O
better	O

The	O
entrees	B-A
were	O
served	O
with	O
miso	O
soup	O
and	O
rice	O

The	O
sake’s	B-A
complimented	O
the	O
courses	O
very	O
well	O
and	O
is	O
successfully	O
easing	O
me	O
into	O
the	O
sake	O
world	O

For	O
desserts	O
,	O
we	O
tried	O
the	O
frozen	B-A
black	I-A
sesame	I-A
mousse	I-A
interesting	O
but	O
not	O
extraordinary	O
and	O
matcha	B-A
powdered	I-A
green	I-A
tea	I-A
and	I-A
blueberry	I-A
cheesecake	I-A
which	O
was	O
phenomenal	O

Maybe	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
great	O
company	O
I	O
had	O
friends	O
visiting	O
from	O
Philly	O
–	O
yes	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
date	O
this	O
time	O
or	O
the	O
super	O
reasonable	O
price	O
point	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
just	O
can’t	O
say	O
enough	O
good	O
things	O
about	O
this	O
brasserie	B-A

I	O
don’t	O
usually	O
visit	O
the	O
same	O
establishment	O
more	O
than	O
once	O
,	O
what	O
more	O
twice	O
,	O
but	O
I’ll	O
come	O
to	O
Zenkichi	B-A
anytime	O
for	O
a	O
quiet	O
,	O
unhurried	O
and	O
memorable	O
dinner	O

Terrible	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
compliment	O

The	O
service	B-A
leaves	O
much	O
to	O
be	O
desired	O
,	O
from	O
feeling	O
like	O
you	O
are	O
rushed	O
the	O
place	O
your	O
order	O
,	O
to	O
being	O
ignored	O

We	O

we	O
were	O
not	O
served	O
and	O
were	O
too	O

tired	O
to	O

They	O
are	O
extremely	O
rude	O
,	O
not	O
even	O
apologizing	O
for	O
the	O
horrible	O
service	B-A
we	O

and	O

the	O

Shabu	I-A
you	O

that	O
even	O
compares	O

even	O
then	O
I	O
prefer	O
Dokebi	O

The	O
meat	B-A
is	O
fresh	O
,	O
the	O

are	O
great	O
,	O
you	O
get	O
kimchi	B-A
and	O
a	O
salad	B-A
free	O
with	O
your	O
meal	B-A
and	O
service	B-A
is	O

the	O

is	O
the	O
fantastic	O
pork	B-A

The	O

The	O

was	O
very	O
good	O

The	O

We	O
order	O
a	O

everything	O
on	O
the	O

Price	O
is	O
high	O
but	O
the	O
food	B-A
is	O
good	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
would	O
come	O
back	O
again	O

This	O
place	B-A
doesnt	O
make	O
any	O
sense	O

Just	O
want	O
to	O
warn	O
you	O
all	O
dont	O
waste	O
your	O

This	O

the	O

make	O
you	O

and	O
delusional	O

This	O
place	B-A
is	O
not	O
inviting	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
is	O
totally	O
weird	O

The	O
concept	O
of	O
japanese	B-A

The	O

Good	O
Food	B-A

I	O
went	O
here	O
with	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
for	O
our	O
anniversary	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
great	O
and	O
tasty	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
sitting	B-A
space	I-A
was	O
too	O
small	O
,	O
I	O
dont	O
like	O
being	O
cramp	O
in	O
a	O

Over	O
all	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
nice	O

I	O
would	O

to	O
ask	O
for	O
a	O
bigger	O

when	O
you	O
make	O
a	O

Loved	O

I	O
tried	O
Pacifico	B-A
after	O

a	O

Fridays	O
and	O
loved	O
it	O

The	O
atmosphere	B-A
was	O

The	O
food	B-A
we	O
ordered	O
was	O
excellent	O

although	O
I	O
wouldnt	O

the	O

were	O
anything	O
to	O

about	O

Our	O

wasnt	O

but	O
not	O
especially	O
warm	O
or	O
attentive	O
either	O

I	O
must	O
say	O
I	O
am	O
surprised	O
by	O
the	O
bad	O
reviews	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	B-A
earlier	O
in	O
the	O
year	O
,	O
though	O

Maybe	O
it	O
has	O
improved	O
since	O

This	O

our	O

We	O
arrived	O
and	O
were	O

immediately	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
us	O
both	O

We	O
ordered	O
our	O
appetizers	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
chicken	O
and	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
the	O
salmon	O

Everything	O
was	O
going	O
good	O
until	O
we	O
got	O
our	O
meals	B-A

I	O
took	O
one	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
chicken	B-A
and	O
I	O
was	O
appalled	O

It	O
was	O
served	O
with	O
skin	O
,	O
over	O
a	O
bed	O
of	O
extremely	O
undercooked	O
spinach	B-A
and	O
mashed	O
potatoes	O

My	O
boyfriend	O
asked	O
me	O
if	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
switch	O
and	O
eat	O
his	O
salmon	O
instead	O
,	O
while	O
he	O
deskinned	O
the	O
chicken	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
enjoy	O
the	O
white	O
meat	O

I	O
took	O
one	O
bite	O
from	O
the	O
24	O
salmon	B-A
and	O
I	O
have	O
never	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
17	O
years	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
going	O
to	O
restaurants	O
tasted	O
salmon	O
as	O
fishy	O
,	O
as	O
dry	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
bland	O
as	O
the	O
one	O
in	O
Flatbush	O
Farms	O

At	O
this	O
point	O
,	O
the	O
waitress	B-A
comes	O
over	O
and	O
asks	O
us	O
if	O
everything	O
was	O
okay	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
literally	O
so	O
shocked	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
speechless	O
and	O
didnt	O
say	O
anything	O
,	O
and	O
guess	O
what	O
,	O
the	O
waitress	O
WALKED	O
away	O

So	O
,	O
I	O
switch	O
with	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
again	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
maybe	O
I	O
could	O
stomach	O
the	O
meat	O
and	O
spinach	O
again	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
spinach	B-A
was	O
so	O
undercooked	O
that	O
I	O
just	O
could	O
not	O
bite	O
through	O
it	O

I	O
couldnt	O
even	O
enjoy	O
the	O
mashed	O
potatoes	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
hidden	O
completely	O
under	O
the	O
chicken	O
and	O
spinach	O

Ive	O
had	O
better	O
chicken	O
at	O
BBQs	O

So	O
I	O
decide	O
to	O
report	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
waitress	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
completely	O
inedible	O

Guess	O
what	O
,	O
I	O
waited	O
for	O
TWENTY	O
minutes	O
before	O
she	O
came	O
over	O
and	O
when	O
she	O

After	O
that	O

,	O
walked	O
away	O
,	O
came	O
back	O
another	O
TWENTY	O

I	O

my	O

took	O
the	O

went	O

the	O

This	O

The	O

you	O

I	O
was	O
almost	O
amused	O
by	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
turning	O
away	O
customers	O
at	O
9pm	O
on	O
a	O
Friday	O
night	O
because	O
she	O
had	O
a	O

to	O
go	O
to	O
that	O
night	O

Id	O
be	O
horrified	O
if	O
my	O

were	O

away	O

so	O
early	O
and	O
so	O

Theres	O
another	O
girl	B-A
who	O
I	O
cant	O
describe	O
,	O
she	O
is	O
about	O
56	O
with	O
brown	O
hair	O
,	O
who	O
eavesdrops	O
on	O
your	O
conversation	O
and	O
chimes	O
in	O
except	O
she	O
only	O
hears	O
the	O
last	O
part	O
of	O
what	O
you	O
said	O
,	O
so	O
her	O
uninvited	O
opinions	O
are	O
often	O
out	O
of	O
context	O
and	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
what	O
youre	O
really	O
talking	O
about	O

Im	O
a	O
friendly	O
person	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
wouldnt	O
mind	O
had	O
she	O
not	O
been	O
so	O
nasty	O
and	O
gotten	O
so	O
personal	O

Again	O
,	O
Id	O
be	O
super	O
upset	O
if	O
that	O

The	O

the	O

behavior	O
by	O
a	O

His	O

at	O

Don’t	O

experience	O
at	O
Casa	B-A

on	O
a	O
Saturday	O
dinner	O

Appetizers	O
took	O
nearly	O
an	O

When	O
the	O
main	O

finally	O
arrived	O
another	O
45mins	O
half	O
of	O
our	O
order	O
was	O
missing	O

Never	O
got	O
an	O
explanation	O
as	O
to	O
what	O
was	O
going	O
on	O

The	O
manager	B-A
was	O
rude	O
and	O
handled	O
the	O
situation	O
extremely	O
poorly	O

When	O
we	O
threatened	O
to	O
leave	O

we	O
were	O
offered	O
a	O
meager	O
discount	O
even	O
though	O
half	O
the	O
order	O
was	O
missing	O

On	O
the	O
way	O
out	O
,	O
we	O
heard	O
of	O
other	O
guests	O
complaining	O
about	O
similar	O
issues	O

Can’t	O
believe	O
how	O
an	O
expensive	O
NYC	O
restaurant	B-A
can	O
be	O
so	O
disrespectful	O
to	O
its	O
clients	O

What	O
a	O
hassle	O

The	O
food	B-A
is	O
very	O
good	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
outstanding	O

There	O
is	O
no	O
way	O
it	O
justifies	O
the	O
accolades	O
it	O
receives	O
,	O
the	O
attitude	O
of	O
the	O

or	O
the	O

for	O
a	O

On	O
our	O

they	O
skipped	O
over	O

on	O
the	O

,	O
leaving	O
us	O
waiting	O
an	O
extra	O
hour	O
for	O

Mistakes	O

they	O
are	O
usually	O
accompanied	O
by	O
an	O
apology	O

perhaps	O
even	O
a	O

not	O
the	O

that	O
we	O

from	O
the	O

Without	O
the	O

or	O
attitude	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
probably	O
go	O
back	O
,	O
but	O
there	O
are	O
just	O
too	O
many	O
other	O
restaurants	O
in	O
Brooklyn	O
that	O
are	O
as	O
good	O
or	O
better	O
and	O
dont	O
make	O
me	O
jump	O
through	O

Expensive	O

I	O
went	O
there	O
after	O
hearing	O
how	O
great	O
it	O
was	O

Wow	O

The	O
bread	B-A
was	O
stale	O
,	O
the	O
salad	B-A
was	O
overpriced	O
and	O
empty	O

The	O
pasta	B-A
was	O
well	O
cooked	O
,	O
didnt	O
have	O
enough	O
sauce	O
though	O
or	O
flavor	O

I	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
expensive	O
and	O
I	O
prefer	O
Bella	O
Via	O
just	O
blocks	O
away	O
by	O
far	O

So	O
rude	O

I	O
went	O
with	O
JWILS	O

Her	O
review	O
is	O
above	O

I	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
that	O
went	O
for	O
this	O
horrible	O
experience	O

My	O
friend	O
is	O
100	O
right	O
in	O
the	O
experience	O
we	O
had	O

The	O
hostess	B-A
was	O
rude	O
and	O
I	O
got	O
a	O
distinct	O
feeling	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
serve	O
us	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
that	O
my	O
friend	O
left	O
out	O
is	O
that	O
when	O
we	O
sat	O
down	O
at	O
the	O
bar	O
the	O
bartender	B-A
disappeared	O

I	O
asked	O
for	O
a	O
menu	O
and	O
the	O
same	O
waitress	B-A
looked	O
at	O
my	O
like	O
I	O
was	O
insane	O

I	O
was	O
shocked	O
that	O
my	O
friends	O
wanted	O
to	O
stay	O
after	O
the	O
waitress	B-A
said	O
,	O
can	O
I	O
help	O
you	O
and	O
how	O
many	O
are	O
in	O
your	O
party	O

What	O

The	O
three	O
of	O
us	O
standing	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
her	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
an	O
indication	O
of	O
how	O
many	O
of	O
us	O
there	O
were	O

We	O
didnt	O
look	O
like	O
the	O
other	O
patrons	O
in	O
there	O
so	O
unfortunately	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
problem	O

Shame	O
on	O
this	O
place	O
for	O
the	O
horrible	O
rude	O
staff	B-A
and	O
nonexistent	O
customer	B-A
service	I-A

bad	O
staff	B-A

I	O
generally	O
like	O
this	O

The	O
food	B-A
is	O
good	O

The	O
design	O
of	O
the	O
space	B-A
is	O
good	O

But	O
the	O
service	B-A
is	O
HORRID	O

I	O
was	O
there	O
for	O
brunch	O
recently	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
tag	O
teamed	O
by	O
a	O
waitress	B-A
and	O
a	O
waiter	B-A

The	O
waiter	B-A
delivered	O
our	O
food	O
while	O
holding	O
what	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
plastic	O
bag	O
of	O
garbage	O
in	O
one	O
hand	O

I	O
cant	O
believe	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
but	O
please	O
put	O
the	O
bag	O
down	O
before	O
delivering	O
food	O

The	O
waitress	B-A
came	O
to	O
check	O
in	O
on	O
us	O
every	O
few	O
minutes	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
clear	O
the	O
plates	O
while	O
half	O
of	O
us	O
were	O
still	O
eating	O
a	O
big	O
pet	O
peeve	O
of	O
mine	O
that	O
happens	O
almost	O
everywhere	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
try	O
to	O
ignore	O
it	O

I	O
couldnt	O
ignore	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
she	O
reach	O
over	O
the	O
plate	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
friends	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
in	O
mid	O
bite	O
,	O
to	O
clear	O
the	O
table	O

She	O
then	O
put	O
the	O
check	O
down	O
without	O
asking	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
done	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
check	O
on	O
the	O
bill	O
every	O
two	O
minutes	O
,	O
even	O
though	O
we	O
were	O
one	O
of	O
three	O

I	O
wish	O
I	O
could	O

I	O
