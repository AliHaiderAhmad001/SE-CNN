Judging	O
from	O
previous	O
posts	O
this	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
good	O
place	B-A
,	O
but	O
not	O
any	O
longer.	O

We,	O
there	O
were	O
four	O
of	O
us,	O
arrived	O
at	O
noon	O
-	O
the	O
place	O
was	O
empty	O
-	O
and	O
the	O
staff	B-A
	O
acted	O
like	O
we	O
were	O
imposing	O
on	O
them	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
rude.	O

They	O
never	O
brought	O
us	O
complimentary	O
noodles,	O
ignored	O
repeated	O
requests	O
for	O
sugar,	O
and	O
threw	O
our	O
dishes	O
on	O
the	O
table.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
lousy	O
-	O
too	O
sweet	O
or	O
too	O
salty	O
and	O
the	O
portions	B-A
	O
tiny.	O

After	O
all	O
that,	O
they	O
complained	O
to	O
me	O
about	O
the	O
small	O
tip.	O

Avoid	O
this	O
place	B-A
!	O

I	O
have	O
eaten	O
at	O
Saul,	O
many	O
times,	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
always	O
consistently,	O
outrageously	O
good.	O

Saul	B-A
	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
restaurant	O
on	O
Smith	O
Street	O
and	O
in	O
Brooklyn.	O

The	O
duck	B-A
confit	I-A
	O
is	O
always	O
amazing	O
and	O
the	O
foie	B-A
gras	I-A
terrine	I-A
with	I-A
figs	I-A
	O
was	O
out	O
of	O
this	O
world.	O

The	O
wine	B-A
list	I-A
	O
is	O
interesting	O
and	O
has	O
many	O
good	O
values.	O

For	O
the	O
price,	O
you	O
cannot	O
eat	O
this	O
well	O
in	O
Manhattan.	O

I	O
was	O
very	O
disappointed	O
with	O
this	O
restaurant	B-A
.	O

Ive	O
asked	O
a	O
cart	B-A
attendant	I-A
	O
for	O
a	O
lotus	O
leaf	O
wrapped	O
rice	O
and	O
she	O
replied	O
back	O
rice	O
and	O
just	O
walked	O
away.	O

I	O
had	O
to	O
ask	O
her	O
three	O
times	O
before	O
she	O
finally	O
came	O
back	O
with	O
the	O
dish	O
Ive	O
requested.	O

Food	B-A
	O
was	O
okay,	O
nothing	O
great.	O

Chow	B-A
fun	I-A
	O
was	O
dry;	O
pork	B-A
shu	I-A
mai	I-A
	O
was	O
more	O
than	O
usually	O
greasy	O
and	O
had	O
to	O
share	O
a	O
table	O
with	O
loud	O
and	O
rude	O
family.	O
	O

I/we	O
will	O
never	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
this	O
place	B-A
	O
again.	O

Went	O
on	O
a	O
3	O
day	O
oyster	O
binge,	O
with	O
Fish	B-A
	O
bringing	O
up	O
the	O
closing,	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
so	O
glad	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
place	O
it	O
O	O
trip	O
ended,	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
great!	O

Service	B-A
	O
was	O
devine,	O
oysters	B-A
	O
where	O
a	O
sensual	O
as	O
they	O
come,	O
and	O
the	O
price	O
can't	O
be	O
beat!!!	O

You	O
can't	O
go	O
wrong	O
here.	O

Every	O
time	O
in	O
New	O
York	O
I	O
make	O
it	O
a	O
point	O
to	O
visit	O
Restaurant	B-A
Saul	I-A
	O
on	O
Smith	O
Street.	O

Everything	O
is	O
always	O
cooked	O
to	O
perfection,	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
excellent,	O
the	O
decor	B-A
	O
cool	O
and	O
understated.	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
duck	B-A
breast	I-A
special	I-A
	O
on	O
my	O
last	O
visit	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
incredible.	O

Can't	O
wait	O
wait	O
for	O
my	O
next	O
visit.	O

I	O
had	O
my	O
eyes	O
on	O
this	O
place,	O
promising	O
myself	O
I	O
will	O
one	O
day	O
'give	O
it	O
a	O
try.'	O

And	O
I	O
hate	O
to	O
say	O
this	O
but	O
I	O
doubt	O
I'll	O
ever	O
go	O
back.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
average...the	O
Thai	B-A
fusion	I-A
stuff	I-A
	O
is	O
a	O
bit	O
too	O
sweet,	O
every	O
thing	O
they	O
serve	O
is	O
too	O
sweet	O
here.	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
I	O
moderately	O
enjoyed	O
was	O
their	O
Grilled	B-A
Chicken	I-A
special	I-A
with	I-A
Edamame	I-A
Puree	I-A
.	O

I	O
had	O
never	O
had	O
Edamame	B-A
pureed	I-A
	O
before	O
but	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
innovative	O
and	O
tasty	O
(could've	O
used	O
a	O
bit	O
more	O
salt).	O

Anyways,	O
if	O
you're	O
in	O
the	O
neighborhood	O
to	O
eat	O
good	O
food,	O
I	O
wouldn't	O
waste	O
my	O
time	O
trying	O
to	O
find	O
something,	O
rather	O
go	O
across	O
the	O
street	O
to	O
Tamari.	O

The	O
decor	B-A
	O
is	O
night	O
tho...but	O
they	O
REALLY	O
need	O
to	O
clean	O
that	O
vent	B-A
	O
in	O
the	O
ceiling...its	O
quite	O
un-appetizing,	O
and	O
kills	O
your	O
effort	O
to	O
make	O
this	O
place	B-A
	O
look	O
sleek	O
and	O
modern.	O

We	O
ate	O
outside	O
at	O
Haru's	O
Sake	O
bar	O
because	O
Haru's	O
restaurant	O
next	O
door	O
was	O
overflowing.	O

What's	O
the	O
difference	O
between	O
the	O
two?	O

Their	O
sake	B-A
list	I-A
	O
was	O
extensive,	O
but	O
we	O
were	O
looking	O
for	O
Purple	O
Haze,	O
which	O
wasn't	O
listed	O
but	O
made	O
for	O
us	O
upon	O
request!	O

The	O
spicy	B-A
tuna	I-A
roll	I-A
	O
was	O
unusually	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
rock	B-A
shrimp	I-A
tempura	I-A
	O
was	O
awesome,	O
great	O
appetizer	O
to	O
share!	O

We	O
went	O
around	O
9:30	O
on	O
a	O
Friday	O
and	O
it	O
had	O
died	O
down	O
a	O
bit	O
by	O
then	O
so	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
great!	O

we	O
love	O
th	O
pink	B-A
pony	I-A
.	O

THe	O
perfect	O
spot	B-A
.	O

Food	B-A
-awesome.	O

Service	B-A
-	O
friendly	O
and	O
attentive.	O

Ambiance	B-A
-	O
relaxed	O
and	O
stylish.	O

Don't	O
judge	O
this	O
place	B-A
	O
prima	O
facie,	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
try	O
it	O
to	O
believe	O
it,	O
a	O
home	O
away	O
from	O
home	O
for	O
the	O
literate	O
heart.	O

i	O
have	O
eaten	O
here	O
a	O
handful	O
of	O
times,	O
for	O
no	O
reason	O
besides	O
sheer	O
convenience.	O

(i	O
hang	O
out,	O
and	O
live,	O
in	O
the	O
neighborhood..)	O

the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
decent.	O

however,	O
it's	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
that	O
leaves	O
a	O
bad	O
taste	O
in	O
my	O
mouth.	O

i	O
happen	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
policy	O
that	O
goes	O
along	O
with	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
self-respect,	O
which	O
includes	O
not	O
letting	O
a	O
waiter	B-A
	O
intimidate	O
me,	O
i.e.	O
make	O
me	O
feel	O
bad	O
asking	O
for	O
trivialities	O
like	O
water,	O
or	O
the	O
check.	O

i	O
know,	O
you	O
were	O
too	O
busy	O
showing	O
off	O
your	O
vintage	O
tee	O
shirt	O
and	O
looking	O
bored,	O
but	O
my	O
agenda	O
is	O
i'm	O
here	O
to	O
eat	O
and	O
enjoy	O
the	O
company	O
of	O
friends,	O
seeking	O
a	O
pleasant	O
experience.	O

well,	O
i	O
didn't	O
find	O
it	O
there,	O
and	O
trust,	O
i	O
have	O
told	O
everyone	O
i	O
can	O
think	O
of	O
about	O
my	O
experience.	O

the	O
last	O
time	O
i	O
walked	O
by	O
it	O
looked	O
pretty	O
empty.	O
hmmm.	O

This	O
place	B-A
	O
has	O
got	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
best	O
japanese	O
restaurant	O
in	O
the	O
new	O
york	O
area.	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
experience.	O

Food	B-A
	O
is	O
great.	O

Service	B-A
	O
is	O
top	O
notch.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
going	O
back	O
again	O
and	O
again.	O

I	O
tend	O
to	O
judge	O
a	O
sushi	O
restaurant	O
by	O
its	O
sea	B-A
urchin	I-A
,	O
which	O
was	O
heavenly	O
at	O
sushi	O
rose.	O

It	O
melted	O
in	O
my	O
little	O
mouth	O
and	O
the	O
perfect	O
consistency-not	O
too	O
fishy,	O
creamy,	O
and	O
slightly	O
buttery.	O

The	O
sushi	B-A
	O
seemed	O
pretty	O
fresh	O
and	O
was	O
adequately	O
proportioned.	O

The	O
rice	B-A
to	I-A
fish	I-A
ration	I-A
	O
was	O
also	O
good--they	O
didn't	O
try	O
to	O
overpack	O
the	O
rice.	O

We	O
took	O
advanatage	O
of	O
the	O
half	B-A
price	I-A
sushi	I-A
deal	I-A
	O
on	O
saturday	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
well	O
worth	O
it.	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
this	O
restaurant	O
with	O
a	O
woman	O
that	O
I	O
met	O
recently.	O

She	O
lives	O
nearby	O
but	O
had	O
never	O
gone	O
to	O
this	O
establishment	O
thinking	O
that	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
too	O
touristy.	O

Surprisingly	O
nothing	O
could	O
be	O
further	O
from	O
the	O
truth.	O

In	O
the	O
evening,	O
this	O
place	O
attracted	O
a	O
well	O
dressed,	O
with	O
it,	O
NY	O
crowd	B-A
.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
well	O
prepared	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
impecable.	O

I'm	O
going	O
back.	O

Having	O
hunted	O
around	O
for	O
a	O
quiet,	O
romantic,	O
yet	O
not	O
hideously	O
expensive	O
restaurant	O
I	O
stumbled	O
across	O
reviews	O
for	O
La	O
Lanterna	O
and	O
gave	O
it	O
a	O
shot.	O

Quite	O
simply	O
it's	O
like	O
stepping	O
out	O
of	O
Manhattan	O
and	O
into	O
a	O
haven	O
of	O
tranquility.	O

The	O
service	O
was	O
attentive,	O
yet	O
unimposing,	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
far	O
better	O
than	O
many	O
notorious	O
restaurants	O
in	O
Midtown	O
and	O
the	O
wine	O
list	O
is	O
extensive	O
and	O
well	O
priced.	O

The	O
Prix	B-A
Fixe	I-A
menu	I-A
	O
is	O
worth	O
every	O
penny	O
and	O
you	O
get	O
more	O
than	O
enough	O
(both	O
in	O
quantity	O
AND	O
quality).	O

I	O
will	O
be	O
going	O
back	O
and	O
heartily	O
recommend	O
it!	O

I've	O
had	O
the	O
lunch	O
buffet	O
at	O
Chennai	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
times,	O
when	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
in	O
the	O
neighborhood.	O

It	O
is	O
terrific,	O
as	O
is	O
the	O
value.	O

$6	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
much	O
tasty	O
food	B-A
,	O
all	O
of	O
it	O
fresh	O
and	O
continually	O
refilled.	O

I	O
am	O
not	O
a	O
vegetarian	O
but,	O
almost	O
all	O
the	O
dishes	B-A
	O
were	O
great.	O

Frankly,	O
when	O
you	O
compare	O
what	O
you	O
can	O
have	O
here	O
for	O
lunch,	O
versus	O
McDs	O
or	O
so	O
many	O
other	O
sandwich	O
shops	O
in	O
the	O
city,	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
comparison.	O

Go	O
hungry	O
and	O
enjoy.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
here	O
is	O
rather	O
good,	O
but	O
only	O
if	O
you	O
like	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
it.	O

I	O
like	O
the	O
somosas	B-A
,	O
chai	B-A
,	O
and	O
the	O
chole	B-A
,	O
but	O
the	O
dhosas	B-A
	O
and	O
dhal	B-A
	O
were	O
kinda	O
dissapointing.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
varys	O
from	O
day	O
to	O
day-	O
sometimes	O
they're	O
very	O
nice,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
not.	O

The	O
kitchen	B-A
	O
however,	O
is	O
almost	O
always	O
slow.	O

Also,	O
specify	O
if	O
you	O
like	O
your	O
food	B-A
	O
spicy-	O
its	O
rather	O
bland	O
if	O
you	O
don't.	O

The	O
ambience	B-A
	O
is	O
pretty	O
and	O
nice	O
for	O
conversation,	O
so	O
a	O
casual	O
lunch	O
here	O
would	O
probably	O
be	O
best.	O

Just	O
went	O
here	O
for	O
my	O
girlfriends	O
23rd	O
bday.	O

If	O
you've	O
ever	O
been	O
along	O
the	O
river	O
in	O
Weehawken	O
you	O
have	O
an	O
idea	O
of	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
view	B-A
	O
the	O
chart	O
house	O
has	O
to	O
offer.	O

Add	O
to	O
that	O
great	O
service	B-A
	O
and	O
great	O
food	B-A
	O
at	O
a	O
reasonable	O
price	O
and	O
you	O
have	O
yourself	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
a	O
great	O
evening.	O

The	O
lava	B-A
cake	I-A
dessert	I-A
	O
was	O
incredible	O
and	O
I	O
recommend	O
it.	O

Once	O
you	O
step	O
into	O
Cosette	B-A
,	O
you're	O
miraculously	O
in	O
a	O
small,	O
off-the-beaten	O
path	O
Parisian	O
bistro.	O

This	O
tiny	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
is	O
as	O
cozy	O
as	O
it	O
gets,	O
with	O
that	O
certain	O
Parisian	O
flair.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
average	O
to	O
above-average;	O
the	O
French	B-A
Onion	I-A
soup	I-A
	O
filling	O
yet	O
not	O
overly	O
impressive,	O
and	O
the	O
desserts	B-A
	O
not	O
brilliant	O
in	O
any	O
way.	O

However,	O
go	O
for	O
the	O
ambience	B-A
,	O
and	O
consider	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
just	O
a	O
companion	O
for	O
a	O
trip	O
across	O
the	O
world!	O

I	O
have	O
never	O
eaten	O
in	O
the	O
restaurant,	O
however,	O
upon	O
reading	O
the	O
reviews	O
I	O
got	O
take	O
out	O
last	O
week.	O

IT	O
WAS	O
HORRIBLE.	O

The	O
pizza	B-A
	O
was	O
delivered	O
cold	O
and	O
the	O
cheese	B-A
	O
wasn't	O
even	O
fully	O
melted!	O

It	O
looked	O
like	O
shredded	O
cheese	O
partly	O
done	O
-	O
still	O
in	O
strips.	O

I	O
have	O
eaten	O
at	O
many	O
pizza	O
places	O
around	O
NYC	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
hands	O
down	O
the	O
worst.	O

This	O
has	O
got	O
to	O
be	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
overrated	O
restaurants	O
in	O
Brooklyn.	O

The	O
pizza	B-A
	O
is	O
overpriced	O
and	O
soggy.	O

Yes,	O
they	O
use	O
fancy	O
ingredients	B-A
,	O
but	O
even	O
fancy	O
ingredients	O
don't	O
make	O
for	O
good	O
pizza	B-A
	O
unless	O
someone	O
knows	O
how	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
crust	B-A
	O
right.	O

A	O
big	O
disappointment,	O
all	O
around.	O

I	O
think	O
I've	O
had	O
some	O
the	O
best	O
meals	B-A
	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
at	O
minnow.	O

The	O
seafood	B-A
	O
is	O
amazing,	O
there's	O
a	O
good	O
wine	B-A
list	I-A
,	O
and	O
the	O
ever-changing	O
menu	B-A
	O
always	O
offers	O
some	O
great	O

lived	O
in	O
the	O

I	O
was	O
just	O
so	O
amazed	O
at	O
this	O

This	O

ALL	O
TOTALLY	O
Japanese.	O

This	O

is	O
worth	O
an	O
one-hour	O
drive.	O

I	O

Our	O

Everytime	O
I	O
decide	O
to	O

another	O
place	O
on	O
the	O

I	O
get	O
angry	O
that	O
I	O
didn't	O
just	O
go	O
to	O
Zucchero	B-A
Pomodori	I-A
.	O

This	O
is	O
by	O
far	O
my	O
favorite	O
place	B-A
	O
in	O
the	O
neighborhood.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
excellent,	O
the	O
decor	B-A
	O
is	O
great,	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
delicious	O
and	O
comes	O
in	O
large	O
portions	B-A
.	O

You'll	O
pay	O
at	O
least	O
double	O
at	O
any	O
other	O
Italian	O
restaurant	O
in	O
the	O
city,	O
and	O
most	O
still	O
don't	O
compare.	O

I'm	O
partial	O
to	O
the	O
Gnocchi	B-A
.	O

This	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
incredibly	O
tiny.	O

They	O
refuse	O
to	O
seat	O
parties	O
of	O
3	O
or	O
more	O
on	O
weekends.	O

The	O
hostess	B-A
	O
is	O
rude	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
being	O
offensive.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
bland	O
oily.	O

I	O
just	O
don't	O
understand	O
all	O
the	O
hype...	O

We	O
went	O
to	O
Ino	O
for	O
Valentines.	O

We	O
have	O
been	O
to	O
this	O
place	O
many	O
times,	O
and	O
always	O
have	O
great	O
food	B-A
,	O
wine	B-A
,	O
and	O
service	B-A
.	O

We	O
were	O
worried	O
we	O
would	O
have	O
trouble	O
getting	O
in,	O
but	O
somehow	O
managed	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
short	O
wait	B-A
.	O

As	O
always	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
glass	B-A
of	I-A
wine	I-A
	O
while	O
we	O
waited.	O

When	O
we	O
sat,	O
we	O
got	O
great	O
and	O
fast	O
service	B-A
.	O

The	O
people	B-A
	O
that	O
work	O
there	O
are	O
always	O
so	O
friendly	O
you	O
forget	O
you	O
are	O
in	O
New	O
York	O
sometimes.	O

Make	O
sure	O
you	O
try	O
this	O
place	B-A
	O
as	O
often	O
as	O
you	O
can.	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
fun	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
to	O
go	O
to.	O

The	O
pizza	B-A
	O
is	O
yummy	O
and	O
I	O
like	O
the	O
atmoshpere	B-A
.	O

But	O
the	O
pizza	B-A
	O
is	O
way	O
to	O
expensive.	O

A	O
large	O
is	O
$20,	O
and	O
toppings	O
are	O
about	O
$3	O
each.	O

I	O
went	O
there	O
for	O
lunch	B-A
	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
I	O
expected	O
from	O
the	O
reviews	O
I	O
read.	O

Sauce	B-A
	O
was	O
watery	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
didn't	O
have	O
much	O
flavor.	O

If	O
you	O
like	O
the	O
food	O
and	O
the	O
value	O
you	O
get	O
from	O
some	O
of	O
Chinatown	O
restaurants,	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
place	O
for	O
you.	O

I	O
don't	O
think	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
again.	O

This	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
great.	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
huge	O
group	O
for	O
my	O
birthday	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
well	O
taken	O
care	O
of.	O

The	O
waitress	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
patient	O
with	O
us	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
phenomenal!	O

Service	B-A
	O
was	O
prompt,	O
friendly	O
and	O
great.	O

Slightly	O
on	O
the	O
pricey	O
side	O
but	O
worth	O
it!	O

Great	O
pizza	B-A
	O
and	O
fantastic	O
service	B-A
.	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
small	O
wait	B-A
,	O
but	O
shorter	O
than	O
I	O
expected.	O

Located	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
a	O
magnificent	O
block.	O

Very	O
cozy	O
and	O
warm	O
inside.....	O

I	O
will	O
be	O
back!	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
best	O

The	O

	O
is	O
small	O
and	O
cramped	O
but	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
fantastic.	O

Planet	B-A
Thailand	I-A
	O
has	O
always	O

I	O
go	O
there	O
usually	O
for	O
the	O

menu	B-A
	O
,	O
I	O
eat	O
here	O
often	O
and	O
never	O
get	O
bored	O
.	O

The	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
isn't	O
the	O
greatest	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
suppose	O
that's	O
how	O
they	O
keep	O
the	O
prices	O
down	O
.	O

It's	O
all	O
about	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
!!	O

I	O
went	O
there	O
with	O
my	O
friend	O
last	O
saturday.	O

first	O
it	O
took	O
us	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
place	B-A
.	O

we	O
were	O
tired	O
and	O
cold	O
when	O
we	O
got	O
to	O
the	O
restaurant,	O
then	O
we	O
sat	O
down	O
to	O
begin	O
ordering	O
appetizers.	O

but	O
when	O
we	O
looked	O
at	O
the	O
menu	B-A
,	O
there	O
weren't	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
choices,	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
dumplings	O
in	O
the	O
appetizer	O
section.	O

then	O
we	O
ordered	O
a	O
dinosaur	O
rolls	O
and	O
white	O
tuna	O
sashimi.	O

those	O
rolls	B-A
	O
were	O
big,	O
but	O
not	O
good	O
and	O
sashimi	B-A
	O
wasn't	O
fresh.	O

they	O
were	O
dry	O
and	O
disgusting,	O
i	O
didn't	O
even	O
finish	O
my	O
first	O
piece.	O

Hurley's	O
is	O
like	O
Cheers	O
where	O
everyone	O
knows	O
your	O
name	O
and	O
they	O
are	O
ACTUALLY	O
glad	O
you	O
came.	O

Try	O
the	O
crunchy	B-A
tuna	I-A
,	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
die	O
for.	O

Try	O
everything	O
for	O
that	O
matter,	O
it	O
is	O
all	O
good.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
going	O
there	O
since	O
it	O
opened	O
and	O
I	O
can't	O
get	O
enough.	O

First	O
went	O
here	O
to	O
enjoy	O
their	O
garden	B-A
terrace	I-A
.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
amazing,	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
prompt	O
and	O
helpful,	O
but	O
not	O
over-bearing	O
or	O
rushed.	O

The	O
Steak	B-A
Tartare	I-A
	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
bet,	O
they	O
fix	O
it	O
for	O
you	O
at	O
the	O
table.	O

Admittedly	O
some	O
nights	O
inside	O
the	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
were	O
rather	O
warm,	O
but	O
the	O
open	B-A
kitchen	I-A
	O
is	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
charm.	O

Great	O
wine	B-A
selection	I-A
,	O
Gigondas	B-A
	O
is	O
worth	O
the	O
price,	O
and	O
the	O
house	B-A
champagne	I-A
	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
value.	O

It	O
may	O
be	O
a	O
bit	O
packed	O
on	O
weekends,	O
but	O
the	O
vibe	B-A
	O
is	O
good	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
French	B-A
food	I-A
	O
you	O
will	O
find	O

it	O
seems	O

when	O
we	O

wonderful.	O

Inside	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
cramped,	O
but	O
to	O
be	O
expected.	O

Service	B-A
	O
was	O
prompt	O
and	O
courteous.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
repeat	O
visit	O
and	O
we'll	O
definitely	O
be	O
back	O
again.	O

Great	O
service	B-A
,	O
great	O
food	B-A
.	O

Prices	O
are	O
in	O
line.	O

Compared	O
to	O
other	O
shabu	O
restaurants	O
around	O
town,	O
this	O
places	O
wins	O
hands-down.	O

But	O
too	O
far	O
east!	O

I	O
live	O
a	O
block	O
away	O
and	O
go	O
to	O
Patsy's	O
frequently.	O

The	O
pizza	B-A
	O
is	O
delicious	O
-	O
they	O
use	O
fresh	B-A
mozzarella	I-A
	O
instead	O
of	O
the	O
cheap,	O
frozen,	O
shredded	O
cheese	O
common	O
to	O
most	O
pizzaria's.	O

Two	O
complaints-	O
their	O
appetizer	B-A
selection	I-A
	O
stinks,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
nice	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
mozzarella	O
sticks	O
on	O
the	O
menu.	O

Also,	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
so	O
thin,	O
it	O
gets	O
cold	O
very	O
quickly	O
and	O
its	O
not	O
that	O
filling.	O

So	O
eat	O
fast	O
and	O
order	O
a	O
lot.	O

Wait	B-A
staff	I-A
	O
is	O
blantently	O
unappreciative	O
of	O
your	O

but	O
its	O
the	O
best	O
pie	B-A
	O
on	O
the	O
UWS!	O

By	O

On	O
a	O
recent	O
Sunday	O
afternoon,	O
a	O
friend	O
and	O
I	O
accidently	O
found	O
this	O
great	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
on	O
our	O
way	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
pulitzer	O
prize	O
winning	O

DOUBT.	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
perfect	O
quiet,	O
relaxing,	O
and	O
delicious	O
accompaniment	O
to	O
our	O
afternoon	O
of	O
theater.	O

The	O
chicken	B-A
pot	I-A
pie	I-A
	O
is	O
excpetiona,	O
the	O
cheeseburger	B-A
	O
huge	O
and	O
delictable,	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
professional	O
wan	O
warm.	O

With	O
so	O
many	O
poor	O
experiences	O
to	O
be	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
theater	O
district,	O
is	O
truly	O
an	O
excellent	O
find!	O

We	O
will	O
return	O
many	O
times	O
for	O
this	O
oasis	O
in	O
mid-town.	O

I	O
grew	O
up	O
on	O
these	O
bagels.	O

The	O
staff	B-A
	O
is	O
no	O
nonsense.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
options	O
rule.	O

When	O
I	O
lived	O
upstate	O
for	O
a	O
while	O
I	O
would	O
buy	O
freeze	O
the	O
bagels	B-A
	O
and	O
they	O
would	O
still	O
be	O
better	O
than	O
any	O
else.	O

Worth	O
visiting	O
the	O
1st	B-A
Ave	I-A
spot	I-A
	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
original	O
store.	O

I	O
stumbled	O
upon	O
this	O
second	O
floor	O
walk-up	O
two	O
Fridays	O
ago	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
with	O
two	O
friends	O
in	O
town	O
from	O
L.A.	O

Being	O
serious	O
sushi	O
lovers,	O
we	O
sat	O
at	O
the	O
sushi	O
bar	O
to	O
be	O
closer	O
to	O
the	O
action.	O

I	O
asked	O
the	O
chef	O
what	O
he	O
recommends	O
and	O
he	O
asked	O
me	O
if	O
I	O
like	O
Uni.	O
(	O

For	O
those	O
of	O
you	O
who	O
don't	O
know,	O
Uni	O
is	O
Sea	O
Urchin	O
in	O
Japanese,	O
which	O
happens	O
to	O
be	O
my	O
favorite.)	O

He	O
served	O
me	O
an	O
Uni	B-A
Hand	I-A
roll	I-A
,	O
which	O
I	O
never	O
had	O
before,	O
and	O
let	O
me	O
tell	O
you...IT	O
WAS	O
HEAVEN!	O

Aside	O
from	O
the	O
Sea	O
Urchin,	O
the	O
chef	O
recommended	O
an	O
assortment	O
of	O
fish	O
including	O
Fatty	O
Yellow	O
Tail,	O
Boton	O
Shrimp,	O
Blue	O
Fin	O
Torro	O
(Fatty	O
Tuna),	O
Sea	O
Eel,	O
etc.	O

The	O
sake	B-A
menu	I-A
	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
overlooked!	O

All	O
in	O
all,	O
this	O
midtown	O
gem	O
instantly	O
became	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
favorite	O
sushi	O
restaurants	O
in	O
the	O
city.	O

Try	O
the	O
lobster	B-A

	O
and	O
the	O

We	O
visited	O
Orsay	O
during	O
NY	O
Restaurant	O
Week	O
and	O
tried	O
their	O
$35	O
menu.	O

Service	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
-	O
prompt,	O
attentive	O
and	O
non-intrusive.	O

Food	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
as	O
well,	O
considering	O
that	O
we	O
tried	O
the	O
budget	O
selection	O
(though	O
I	O
wish	O
the	O
pork	B-A
belly	I-A
	O
that	O
I	O
ordered	O
was	O
roasted	O
a	O
bit	O
longer,	O
so	O
that	O
fat	O
was	O
more	O
of	O
a	O
melt-in-your-mouth	O
experience).	O

Wine	B-A
list	I-A
selection	I-A
	O
is	O
good	O
and	O
wine-by-the-glass	B-A
	O
was	O
generously	O
filled	O
to	O
the	O
top.	O

Traditional	B-A
French	I-A
decour	I-A
	O
was	O
pleasant	O
though	O
the	O
hall	B-A
	O
was	O
rather	O
noisy	O
-	O
the	O
restaurant	O
was	O
full	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
raise	O
our	O
voices	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
maintain	O
a	O
conversation.	O

I've	O
been	O
to	O
at	O
Cafe	B-A
Spice	I-A
	O
probably	O
5-8	O
times,	O
it	O
is	O
probably	O
still	O
the	O
best	O
Indian	O
restaurant	O
around	O
Union	O
Square.	O

To	O
sum	O
it	O
up:	O
Service	B-A
	O
varies	O
from	O
good	O
to	O
mediorce,	O
depending	O
on	O
which	O
waiter	O
you	O
get;	O
generally	O
it	O
is	O
just	O
average	O
Ok.	O
	O

Seating	B-A
	O
is	O
always	O
prompt,	O
though	O
the	O
restaurant	O
does	O
fill	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
evening.	O

Food	B-A
	O
is	O
usually	O
very	O
good,	O
though	O
ocasionally	O
I	O
wondered	O
about	O
freshmess	O
of	O
raw	B-A
vegatables	I-A
in	I-A
side	I-A
orders	I-A
.	O

As	O
many	O
other	O
reviewers	O
noticed,	O
your	O
order	O
is	O
often	O
slow	O
to	O
arrive	O
-	O
this	O
is	O
particularly	O
true	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
but	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
problem	O
during	O
lunch	O
time.	O

The	O
decor	B-A
	O
is	O
vibrant	O
and	O
eye-pleasing	O
with	O
several	O
semi-private	B-A
boths	I-A
	O
on	O
the	O
right	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
dining	O
hall,	O
which	O
are	O
great	O
for	O
a	O
date.	O

I	O
have	O
NEVER	O
been	O
disappointed	O
in	O
the	O
Red	B-A
Eye	I-A
.	O

The	O
first	O
time	O
I	O
went,	O
and	O
was	O
completely	O
taken	O
by	O
the	O
live	B-A
jazz	I-A
band	I-A
	O
and	O
atmosphere	B-A
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
Lobster	O
Cobb	O
Salad.	O

I've	O
never	O
ordered	O
anything	O
else	O
from	O
their	O
menu...there's	O
no	O
need	O
to.	O

It's	O
simply	O
the	O
best	O
meal	B-A
	O
in	O
NYC.	O

You	O
cannot	O
go	O
wrong	O
at	O
the	O
Red	B-A
Eye	I-A
Grill	I-A
.	O

If	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
move	O
from	O
the	O
upper	O
east	O
side,	O
we	O
would	O
genuinely	O
miss	O
this	O
restaurant	B-A
.	O

We've	O
lived	O
in	O
the	O
area	O
for	O
more	O
than	O
8	O
years.	O

The	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
is	O
cute	O
but	O
not	O
upscale.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
a	O
diamond	O
in	O
rough	O
--	O
the	O
food	O
is	O
delicious	O
and	O
homemade	O
with	O
the	O
perfect	O
balance	B-A
of	I-A
herbs	I-A
and	I-A
tomatoes	I-A
.	O

I	O
would	O
highly	O
recommend	O
it.	O

It's	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
favorite	O
places	O
to	O
eat	O
in	O
NY.	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
time	O
at	O
the	O
Jekyll	B-A
and	I-A
hyde	I-A
Pub	I-A
	O
last	O

We	O
were	O
walking	O
around	O
the	O
village	O
and	O
went	O
into	O
this	O
place	O
just	O
for	O
some	O
drinks.	O

After	O
really	O
enjoying	O
ourselves	O
at	O
the	O
bar	B-A
	O
we	O
sat	O
down	O
at	O
a	O
table	O
and	O
had	O
dinner.	O

The	O
server	B-A
	O
was	O
really	O
cool	O
and	O
served	O
us	O
our	O
food	O
and	O
drinks	O
with	O
a	O
smile.	O

The	O
place's	O
decor	B-A
	O
and	O
hidden	B-A
bathrooms	I-A
	O
made	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
laugh.	O

I	O
highly	O
recommend	O
visiting	O
this	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
and	O
having	O

and	O
drinks!	O

If	O

the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
delicious,	O

.	O

The	O
entertainment	B-A
	O
was	O
great	O
they	O
have	O
shows	O
that	O
go	O
on	O
through	O
out	O

Please	O

go	O
and	O
try	O
this	O
place	B-A
.	O

Its	O
located	O
in	O
greenewich	O
village.	O

You	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
disapointed	O
at	O
all.	O

Our	O
first	O
time	O
in	O
New	O
York	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
try	O
a	O
New	O
York	O
Bagel.	O

We	O
were	O
not	O
dissappointed	O
in	O
the	O
least	O
bit	O
by	O
this	O
little	O
gem.	O

The	O
bagel	B-A
	O
was	O
huge.	O

They	O
were	O
served	O
warm	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
soft	O
fluffy	O
interior.	O

The	O
workers	O
there	O
also	O
absolutely	O
load	O
the	O
bagel	B-A
	O
with	O
cream	O
cheese	O
(gets	O
a	O
little	O
messy).	O

I	O
loved	O
it	O
and	O
would	O
HIGHLY	O
RECOMMEND.	O

This	O
was	O
my	O
frist	O
time	O
at	O
Cafe	O
St.	O
Bart's	O
and	O
I	O
must	O
say	O
how	O
delicous	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was.	O

When	O
I	O
called	O
this	O
morning,	O
I	O
didn't	O
think	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
in	O
at	O
12,	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
in,	O
along	O
with	O
four	O
other	O
guests.	O

I	O
have	O
to	O
highly	O
recommend	O
the	O
lobster	B-A
roll	I-A
	O
-	O
not	O
to	O
much	O
mayo;	O
you	O
can	O
tell	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
fresh	O
lobster	B-A
.	O

Other	O
guests	O
enjoyed	O
pizza	B-A
,	O
santa	B-A
fe	I-A
chopped	I-A
salad	I-A
	O
and	O
fish	B-A
and	I-A
chips	I-A
.	O

I	O
highly	O
recommend	O
Cafe	O
St.	O
Bart's	O
for	O
their	O
food	B-A
,	O
the	O
ambience	B-A
	O
and	O
wonderful	O
service	B-A
.	O

All	O
the	O
staff	B-A
	O
is	O
absolutely	O
professional!!	O
	O

I	O
sometimes	O
see	O
the	O
waiters	O
don't	O
have	O
enough	O
knowledge	O
of	O
their	O
dishes.	O

But	O
they	O
do.	O

(that	O
is	O
A	O
MUST,	O
but	O
not	O
every	O
restaurant	O
can	O
do...)	O

If	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
dine	O
with	O
large	O
party,	O
I	O
recommend	O
to	O
make	O
reservation	O
BASEMENT.	O

There's	O
nice	O
and	O
quiet,	O
small	O
but	O
enough	O
for	O
6	O
(or	O
more).	O

This	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
was	O
way	O
overhyped.	O

My	O
chow	B-A
fun	I-A
and	I-A
chow	I-A
see	I-A
	O
was	O
really	O
bland	O
and	O
oily.	O

Okay-i	O
don't	O
mind	O
the	O
oily	O
part	O
(cause	O
most	O
are	O
cooked	O
that	O
way)	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
way	O
too	O
bland.	O

The	O
scallion	B-A
pancakes	I-A
	O
and	O
fried	B-A
dumplings	I-A
	O
were	O
nothing	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ordinary.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
good	O
about	O
this	O
restaurant	B-A
.	O

It's	O
boring	O
on	O
the	O
inside,	O
and	O
our	O
sushi	B-A
	O
was	O
pretty	O
below	O
average...	O
the	O
tuna	B-A
	O
was	O
soggy	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
rolls	B-A
	O
had	O
no	O
flavor.	O

I	O
definitely	O
wouldn't	O
go	O
back.	O

There	O
are	O
many	O
Thai	O
places	O
in	O
the	O
city	O
but	O
so	O
far	O
Toons	O
is	O
#1.	O

Their	O
pad	B-A
penang	I-A
	O
is	O
delicious	O
and	O
everything	O
else	O
is	O
fantastic.	O

The	O
price	O
is	O
reasonable	O
although	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
poor.	O

fresh	B-A
restaurant	I-A
	O
was	O
amazing........	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
delicious	O
and	O
of	O

fresh.	O

great	O
for	O
a	O
romantic	O
evening,	O
or	O
a	O

with	O

I	O
will	O
be	O
going	O
back	O
very	O
soon.	O

keep	O
up	O
the	O
good	O
work.	O

Hats	O

I	O
am	O
not	O
the	O
most	O
experienced	O
person	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
Thai	O
food,	O
but	O
my	O

who	O
took	O
me	O
there	O
is.	O

He	O
has	O
visited	O
Thailand	O
and	O
is	O
quite	O
expert	O
on	O
the	O

It	O
was	O
wonderful.	O

the	O
salads	B-A
	O
are	O
delicious,	O
both	O
refreshing	O
and	O
very	O
spicy.	O

We	O
had	O
Pam's	B-A
special	I-A
fried	I-A
fish	I-A
	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
amazing.	O

too	O
large	O
for	O
just	O
two	O
people	O
but	O
nothing	O
was	O
left.	O

Unbelievable.	O

Had	O
a	O
late	O
night	O
dinner	O
on	O
a	O
Saturday	O
night.	O

Great	O
vibe	B-A
,	O
lots	O
of	O
people.	O

My	O
husband	O
and	O
I	O
both	O
ordered	O
the	O
Steak,	O
medium.	O

My	O
husbands	O
was	O
perfect,	O
my	O
was	O
well	O
done	O
and	O
dry.	O

I	O
didn't	O
complain,	O
I	O
liked	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
so	O
much.	O

Will	O
give	O
it	O
another	O
chance	O
before	O
I	O
write	O
it	O
off.	O

Visited	O
there	O
while	O
on	O
vacation	O
and	O
reading	O
the	O
reviews.	O

On	O
a	O
hot	O
day	O
it	O
was	O
fabulous	O
to	O
stop	O
in	O
and	O
enjoy	O
lunch.	O

Ambience	B-A
	O
is	O
so	O
cute	O
and	O
quaint,	O
good	O
for	O
business	O
although	O
we	O
were	O
there	O
on	O
vacation.	O

Salads	B-A
	O
were	O
fantastic.	O

Although	O
we	O
were	O
looking	O
for	O
regular	O
lettuce	O
and	O
some	O
walnuts	O
the	O
salads	B-A
	O
we	O
got	O
were	O
great.	O

Ingredients	B-A
	O
are	O
organic	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
real	O
plus	O
for	O
me.	O

We	O
will	O
be	O
back.	O

This	O
is	O
some	O
really	O
good,	O
inexpensive	O
sushi	B-A
.	O

It	O
costs	O
$2	O
extra	O
to	O
turn	O
a	O
regular	O
roll	O
into	O
an	O
inside-out	O
roll,	O
but	O
the	O
roll	O
more	O
than	O
triples	O
in	O
size,	O
and	O
that's	O
not	O
just	O
from	O
the	O
rice.	O

The	O
spicy	B-A
Tuna	I-A
roll	I-A
	O
is	O
huge	O
and	O
probably	O
the	O
best	O
that	O
I've	O
had	O
at	O
this	O
price	O
range.	O

The	O
Yellowtail	B-A
	O
was	O
particularly	O
good	O
as	O
well.	O

I	O
have	O
reservations	O
about	O
the	O
all	B-A
you	I-A
can	I-A
eat	I-A
deal	I-A
,	O
however	O
--	O
the	O
choices	O
are	O
fairly	O
limited	O
and	O
you	O
can	O
probably	O
order	O
more	O
food	O
than	O
you	O
can	O
eat	O
for	O
less	O
than	O
$18	O
by	O
just	O
going	O
off	O
the	O
menu.	O

In	O
any	O
event,	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
place	B-A
	O
I'll	O
be	O
sure	O
to	O
stop	O
by	O
again	O
when	O
I'm	O
in	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
town.	O

Big	B-A
Wong	I-A
	O
gets	O
big	O
Ups	O
for	O
a	O
fine	O
establishment.	O

They	O
have	O
it	O
all	O
--	O
great	O
price,	O
food	B-A
,	O
and	O
service	B-A
.	O

The	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
is	O
noisy	O
and	O
the	O
waiters	B-A
	O
are	O
literally	O
walking	O
around	O
doing	O
things	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
they	O
can.	O

The	O
food	O
is	O
prepared	O
quickly	O
and	O
efficiently.	O

And	O
it	O
all	O
comes	O
at	O
a	O
very	O
reasonable	O
price	O
(congee	B-A
,	O
noodles	B-A
,	O
and	O
rice	B-A
dishes	I-A
	O
are	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
$3-6	O
each).	O

The	O
takeout	B-A
	O
is	O
great	O
too	O
since	O
they	O
give	O
high	O
quality	O
tupperware	O
as	O
well.	O

This	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
always	O
very	O
crowded	O
and	O
popular.	O

Went	O
here	O
on	O
a	O
friend's	O
reccomendation.	O

Enjoyed	O
a	O
very	O
nice	O
Caesar	B-A
Salad	I-A
	O
while	O
my	O
wife	O
had	O
arugula	B-A
and	I-A
goat	I-A
cheese	I-A
....both	O
very	O
tasty.	O

We	O
both	O
opted	O
for	O
a	O
pasta	B-A
dish	I-A
	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
served	O
timely	O
and	O
fresh.	O

We	O
concluded	O
with	O
tiramisu	B-A
chocolate	I-A
cake	I-A
,	O
both	O
were	O
delicious.	O

We'd	O
go	O
back	O
again	O

I	O
recently	O
went	O
to	O
this	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
with	O
some	O
co-workers	O
for	O
lunch	O
and	O
had	O
an	O
amazing	O
time.	O

The	O
staff	B-A
	O
was	O
accomodating,	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
absolutely	O
delicious	O
and	O
the	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
lovely.	O

We	O
even	O
had	O
a	O
visit	O
from	O
the	O
Manager	B-A
	O
who	O
wanted	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
we	O
were	O
enjoying	O
ourselves.	O

Yes,	O
the	O
prices	O
are	O
high,	O
but	O
I	O
felt	O
it	O
was	O
worth	O
it.	O

We	O
all	O
felt	O
it	O
was	O
worth	O
it.	O

sometimes	O
i	O
get	O
good	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
ok	O
service	B-A
.	O

sometimes	O
i	O
get	O
bad	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
bad	O
service	B-A
,	O
sometimes	O
i	O
get	O
good	O
good	B-A
	O
and	O
bad	O
service	B-A
.	O

it	O
is	O
not	O
consistent.	O

really	O
depends	O
on	O
your	O
luck!	O

The	O
place	O
is	O
a	O
BISTRO	O
which	O
means:	O
simple	O
dishes	B-A
	O
and	O
wine	B-A
	O
served	O
efficiently	O
in	O
a	O
bustling	O
atmosphere	B-A
.	O

And	O
where	O
does	O
Patis	B-A
	O
go	O
wrong;	O
no	O
where.	O
	O

You	O
are	O
not	O
eating	O
haut	O
cuisine	O
with	O
subtle	O
hints	O
of	O
whatever	O
but:	O
Cassuolet,	O
Steake	O
Fritte,	O
Tripe	O
Stew,	O
etc;	O
simple	O
stuff.	O

And	O
evaluated	O
on	O
those	O
terms	O
Pastis	B-A
	O
is	O
simply	O
wonderful.	O

Right	O
off	O
the	O
L	O
in	O
Brooklyn	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
nice	O
cozy	O
place	B-A
	O
with	O
good	O
pizza	B-A
.	O

Mine	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
burnt	O
but	O
still	O
delicious	O
with	O
goat	O
cheese	O
and	O
panchetta	O
(raddichio	B-A
	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
bitter	O
though).	O

My	O
friend	O
got	O
the	O
mushroom	B-A
pizza	I-A
	O
which	O
tasted	O
better.	O

The	O
sangria	B-A
	O
was	O
pretty	O
tasty	O
and	O
good	O
on	O
a	O
hot	O
muggy	O
day.	O

Kind	O
of	O
a	O
small	O
place	B-A
	O
but	O
I	O
guess	O
if	O
they	O
are	O
not	O
too	O
busy	O
might	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
fit	O
a	O
group	O
or	O
kids.	O

Overall	O
I	O
would	O
recommend	O
it	O
and	O
go	O
back	O
again.	O

Coming	O
from	O
Boston	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
like	O
Emma's	O
Pizza	O
in	O
Kendall	O
Square	O
in	O
Cambridge	O
(although	O
they	O
have	O
more	O
funky	O
toppings!)	O

I	O
started	O
out	O
with	O
a	O
Bombay	B-A
beer	I-A
	O
which	O
was	O
big	O
enough	O
for	O
two.	O

For	O
dinner	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
chicken	O
tikka-masala	O
and	O
some	O
garlic	O
naan.	O

MMmmm...	O
it	O
was	O
delicious.	O

Service	B-A
	O
was	O
slow,	O
but	O
the	O
people	B-A
	O
were	O
friendly.	O

It's	O
a	O
nice	O
place	B-A
	O
to	O
relax	O
and	O
have	O
conversation.	O

I	O
can't	O
wait	O
to	O
go	O
back.	O

We	O
have	O
lived	O
in	O
Chelsea	O
for	O
two	O
years	O
and	O
have	O
never	O
noticed	O
this	O
restaurant.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
authentic	O
Italian	O
-	O
delicious!	O

Pizza	B-A
	O
is	O
terrific,	O
as	O
is	O
homemade	B-A
pasta	I-A
.	O

Ambience	B-A
	O
is	O
delightful,	O
service	B-A
	O
impeccable.	O

I'm	O
still	O
mad	O
that	O
i	O
had	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
lousy	O
food	B-A
.	O

The	O
hanger	B-A
steak	I-A
	O
was	O
like	O
rubber	O
and	O
the	O
tuna	B-A
	O
was	O
flavorless	O
not	O
to	O
mention	O
it	O
tasted	O
like	O
it	O
had	O
just	O
been	O
thawed.	O

Service	B-A
	O
was	O
also	O
horrible	O
and	O
the	O
ambience	B-A
	O
is	O
not	O
that	O
great.	O

DO	O
not	O
try	O
unless	O
you're	O
just	O
going	O
there	O
to	O
hang	O
out	O
like	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
hipsters	O
who	O
apparently	O
have	O
no	O
sense	O
of	O
taste.	O

I	O
go	O
and	O
eat	O
out	O
at	O
many	O
different	O
restaurants	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
one	O
place	B-A
	O
you	O
have	O
go	O
and	O
try.	O

This	O
is	O
my	O
first	O
time	O
writing	O
a	O
review	O
for	O
a	O
restaurant	O
because	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
excellent.	O

The	O
filet	B-A
mignon	I-A
dish	I-A
	O
was	O
superb!	O

I	O
would	O
defiantly	O
come	O
back	O
here	O
again	O
as	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
top	O
choices.	O

It's	O
a	O
small	O
cute	O
restaurant	B-A
.	O

I	O
absolutely	O
love	O
this	O
place	B-A
!!!	O

From	O
the	O
street	O
it	O
looks	O
very	O
hidden,	O
and	O
is	O
actually	O
an	O
old	O
warehouse.	O

I	O
like	O
the	O
ambience	B-A
,	O
it's	O
very	O
dark	O
and	O
original.	O

I	O
came	O
here	O
for	O
my	O
friend's	O
birthday	O
and	O
keep	O
coming	O
back	O
ever	O
since.	O

The	O
sushi	B-A
	O
is	O
amazing!!!	O
	O

And	O
amazingly	O
cheap.	O

Big	O
thumbs	O
up!	O

Very	O
affordable	O
and	O
excellent	O
ambient	B-A
!	O

We	O
ordered	O
some	O
beef	B-A
and	I-A
noodle	I-A
soup	I-A
dishes	I-A
	O
from	O
the	O
Thai	O
section	O
of	O
the	O
menu	O
but	O
nothing	O
we	O
got	O
was	O
Thai.	O

We	O
were	O
very	O
disappointed.	O

We	O
won't	O
go	O
to	O
this	O
place	O
again	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
meal	B-A
.	O

However,	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
a	O
good	O
hang	O
out	O
spot.	O

Next	O
time,	O
we	O
wouldn't	O
dare	O
ordering	O
anything	O
else	O
other	O
than	O
some	O
simple	O
Asian	O
appetizers	O
and	O
drinks.	O

My	O
Girlfriend	O
and	O
I	O
stumbled	O
onto	O
this	O
hopping	O
place	B-A
	O
the	O
other	O
night	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
time!	O

THe	O
Pizza	B-A
	O
and	O
wine	B-A
	O
were	O
excellent-the	O
service	B-A
	O
too--but	O
what	O
really	O
MADE	O
this	O
place	O
was	O
the	O
backyard	B-A
dining	I-A
area	I-A
.	O

It	O
is	O
one	O
the	O
nicest	O
outdoor	B-A
restaurants	I-A
	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
seen	O
in	O
NY--I	O
am	O
from	O
Italy	O
and	O
this	O
place	O
rivals	O
the	O
ones	O
in	O
my	O
country.	O

They	O
tell	O
me	O
they	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
cover	O
the	O
garden	O
in	O
glass	O
for	O
the	O
winter,	O
so	O
i'm	O
looking	O
forward	O
to	O
going	O
there	O
on	O
a	O
snowy	O
night	O
to	O
enjoy	O
it.	O

Check	O
this	O
place	B-A
	O
out!	O

HIGHLY	O
RECOMMENDED!!!!!	O

First	O
of	O
all,	O
this	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
*not*	O
romantic,	O
as	O
claimed	O
by	O
Citysearch's	O
editorial	O
review.	O

Either	O
that,	O
or	O
the	O
editor's	O
idea	O
of	O
romance	O
must	O
be	O
sharing	O
a	O
conversation	O
with	O
the	O
next	O
table,	O
while	O
trying	O
to	O
speak	O
louder	O
than	O
the	O
traffic	O
on	O
57th.	O

The	O
tables	B-A
	O
are	O
crammed	O
way	O
too	O
close,	O
the	O
menu	B-A
	O
is	O
typical	O
of	O
any	O
Italian	O
restaurant,	O
and	O
the	O
wine	B-A
list	I-A
	O
is	O
simply	O
overpriced.	O

Slightly	O
above	O
average	O
wines	B-A
	O
start	O
at	O
$70+	O
with	O
only	O
one	O
selection	O
listed	O
at	O
$30+.	O

Service	B-A
	O
is	O
not	O
what	O
one	O
would	O
expect	O
from	O
a	O
joint	O
in	O
this	O
price	O
category.	O

For	O
instance,	O
plates	O
were	O
just	O
dumped	O
on	O
the	O
table,	O
I	O
was	O
handed	O
the	O
wine	O
list	O
upside	O
down,	O
etc....	O

Somehow	O
working	O
the	O
italian	O
charm	O
with	O
constant	O
mille	O
grazie	O
does	O
not	O
constitute	O
proper	O
service	B-A
.	O

To	O
be	O
completely	O
fair,	O
the	O
only	O
redeeming	O
factor	O
was	O
the	O
food	B-A
,	O
which	O
was	O
above	O
average,	O
but	O
couldn't	O
make	O
up	O
for	O
all	O
the	O
other	O
deficiencies	O
of	O
Teodora	B-A

To	O
celebrate	O
a	O

three	O
of	O

Not	O
one	O

would	O
never	O

the	O

Skip	O
this	O
restaurant	B-A
,	O
it's	O
a	O
big	O
disappointment.	O

Myagi	B-A

I	O

from	O

of	O
pizzeria	O
owners,	O
and	O
I'm	O
almost	O
ashamed	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
the	O
pizza	B-A
	O
in	O
Fornino's	O
blows	O
my	O
families	O
receipies	O
away.	O

It	O
is	O
simply	O
amazing.	O

The	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
so	O
cool	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
prompt	O
and	O
curtious.	O

I	O
highly	O
recommend	O
to	O
anyone	O
to	O
give	O
this	O

	O
a	O
try.	O

You	O
will	O
find	O
yourself	O
returning	O
quite	O
often.	O

P.S.	O
Please	O
don't	O
tell	O
anyone	O

The	O

The	O

The	O

and	O
you	O

a	O

The	O

but	O
the	O

	O
is	O
the	O

	O
that	O
had	O
so	O
much	O
pepper	O
on	O
it	O
that	O
our	O
eyes	O
started	O
watering,	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
here	O
was	O
decent,	O
not	O
great.	O

The	O
menu	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
limited	O
-	O
i	O
think	O
we	O
counted	O
4	O
or	O
5	O
entrees.	O

We	O
ordered	O
the	O
special,	O
grilled	B-A
branzino	I-A
,	O
that	O
was	O
so	O
infused	O
with	O
bone,	O
it	O
was	O
difficult	O
to	O
eat.	O

The	O
decor	B-A
	O
in	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
very	O
diner-ish	O
and	O
the	O
kind	O
of	O
place	O
you	O
expect	O
in	O
the	O
East	O
Village	O
-	O
not	O
romantic,	O
just	O
simple,	O
small	O
and	O
sparse.	O

Problem	O
is	O
nothing	O
at	O
Prune	B-A
	O
is	O
particularly	O
memorable.	O

No	O
plans	O
to	O
return	O
anytime	O
soon.	O

This	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
so	O
much	O
fun.	O

Our	O
family	O
never	O
expected	O
such	O
incredible	O
entertainment	B-A
	O
in	O
a	O
restaurant.	O

This	O
place	O
must	O
have	O
cost	O
the	O
owners	O
afortune	O
to	O
build.	O

I	O
think	O
the	O
stuff	O
was	O
better	O
than	O
Disney.	O

Our	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
great	O
too!	O

And	O
really	O
large	O
portions	B-A
.	O

The	O
staff	B-A
	O
was	O
the	O
friendliest	O
that	O
have	O
seen	O
in	O
New	O
York.	O

We	O
will	O
go	O
back	O
every	O
time	O
we	O
are	O
in	O
the	O
City.	O

If	O
you	O
want	O
something	O
really	O
different	O
than	O
try	O
Jekyll	B-A
and	I-A
Hyde	I-A
.	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
fun	O
with	O
live	O
entertainment	O
and	O
all	O
kinds	O
of	O
Disney	O
type	O
special	O
effects.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
pretty	O
tradional	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
hot	O
and	O
good	O
with	O
large	O
portions	B-A
.	O

I	O
highly	O
recommend	O
it.	O

I	O
am	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
mid	O
town	O
location	O
next.	O

The	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
fun.	O

My	O
six	O
year	O
old	O
loved	O
it.	O

The	O
characters	B-A
	O
really	O
make	O
for	O
an	O
enjoyable	O
experience.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
however,	O
is	O
what	O
one	O
might	O
expect.	O

It	O
is	O
very	O
overpriced	O
and	O
not	O
very	O
tasty.	O

However,	O
I	O
think	O
Jeckll	B-A
and	I-A
Hydes	I-A
	O
t	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
places	O
that	O
is	O
fun	O
to	O
do	O
once.	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
good	O
time.	O

Went	O
there	O
with	O
my	O
wife	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
to	O

for	O
a	O

even	O
though	O
you	O
could	O
see	O
there	O
many	O
that	O
were	O
empty	O
with	O
not	O
reservation	O
sigh	O
on	O
them.	O

Service	B-A
	O
was	O
slow	O
had	O
to	O

although	O
not	O
crowded.	O

Drinks	B-A
	O

Growing	O
up	O
in	O
NY,	O
I	O
have	O

my	O

of	O
bagels.	O

Ess-A-Bagel	O
(either	O
by	O
Sty-town	O
or	O
midtown)	O
is	O
by	O
far	O
the	O
best	O
bagel	B-A
	O
in	O
NY.	O

The	O
bagels	B-A
	O
always	O
warm,	O
soft	O
on	O
the	O
inside,	O
crispy	O
on	O
the	O

They	O

	O
and	O
all	O
of	O
their	O

	O
are	O

The	O

	O
is	O

Highly	O

I	O
have	O
to	O
agree	O
with	O
the	O
previous	O

I	O
don't	O
get	O
it	O
either.	O

Not	O
impressed	O
with	O
the	O
food	B-A
.	O

Prices	O
too	O
high	O
for	O
this	O
cramped	O
and	O
unappealing	O
resturant	B-A
.	O

Zero	O
ambiance	B-A
	O
to	O
boot.	O

I	O
thought	O
this	O
place	B-A
	O
was	O
totally	O
overrated.	O

Everything	O
we	O
had	O
was	O
good	O
or	O
ok....but	O
definitely	O
nothing	O
great.	O

The	O
ambience	B-A
	O
was	O
nice,	O
but	O
service	B-A
	O
wasn't	O
so	O
great.	O

When	O
you	O
add	O
it	O
all	O
together,	O
it	O
just	O
doesn't	O
seem	O
worth	O
it	O
to	O
me...especially	O
considering	O
the	O
prices.	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
BEST	O
Shabu-Shabu	B-A
Restaurant	I-A
	O
in	O
the	O

I	O
have	O

the	O

of	O
the	O

	O
and	O
the	O
feel	B-A
	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	O
is	O
like	O
being	O

Japan.	O

Thius	O
is	O
a	O
must	O
for	O
anyone	O
who	O
loves	O
Shabu-Shabu	B-A
.	O

The	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
is	O
nothing	O
special,	O
but	O
it	O
feels	O
like	O
a	O
Sushi	O
establishment	O
in	O
Tokyo.	O

The	O
owner	B-A
	O
and	O
staff	B-A
	O
are	O
all	O
Japanese	O
as	O

that	O

We	O

it	O
a	O

the	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
good,	O
I	O
can't	O
lie.	O

But	O
the	O
staff	B-A
	O
was	O
so	O
horrible	O
to	O
us.	O

The	O
hostess	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
waitress	B-A
	O
were	O
incredibly	O
rude	O
and	O
did	O
everything	O
they	O
could	O
to	O
rush	O
us	O
out.	O

We	O
were	O
planning	O
to	O
get	O

the	O

	O
basically	O
through	O
the	O

at	O
us	O
before	O
we	O
had	O
a	O

This	O

	O
is	O
pricey,	O
and	O
yes,	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
worth	O
it;	O
but	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
makes	O
you	O
feel	O
like	O
you	O
should	O
be	O
paying	O
a	O
quater	O
of	O
the	O
price.	O

Save	O
yourself	O
the	O

and	O
skip	O
this	O
one!	O

I'll	O

this	O

some	O
of	O

us,	O
we've	O

15	O

not	O

why	O
this	O

	O
would	O

that	O
highly.	O

the	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
to	O
Roth's	B-A
	O
twice	O
and	O
both	O
times	O
were	O
very	O
disappointing.	O

Once	O
for	O
dinner	O
and	O
once	O
for	O
brunch.	O

Both	O
times	O
I	O
was	O
extremely	O
dissappointed	O
by	O
the	O
service	B-A
,	O
which	O
was	O
boarderline	O
rude.	O

They	O
wouldnt	O
even	O
let	O
me	O
finish	O
my	O
glass	O
of	O
wine	O
before	O
offering	O
another.	O

Much	O
of	O
the	O
time	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
care	O
about	O
you.	O

The	O
dinner	B-A
	O
was	O
ok,	O
nothing	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
again.	O

I	O
had	O
their	O
eggs	B-A
benedict	I-A
	O
for	O
brunch,	O
which	O
were	O
the	O
worst	O
in	O
my	O
entire	O
life,	O
I	O
tried	O
removing	O
the	O
hollondaise	O
sauce	O
completely	O
that	O
was	O
how	O
failed	O
it	O
was.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
surprise.	O

With	O
the	O
theater	O
2	O
blocks	O
away	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
delicious	O
meal	B-A
	O
in	O
a	O
beautiful	O
room	B-A
.	O

The	O
service	B-A

I	O

Planet	B-A
Thai	I-A
	O
is	O
great!	O

We	O
love	O
the	O
food	B-A
,	O
drinks	B-A
,	O
and	O
atmosphere	B-A
!	O

The	O
svc	B-A
	O
can	O
be	O
a	O
bit	O
rude	O
at	O
times,	O
esp	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
big	O
group,	O
but	O
overall	O
the	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
is	O
a	O
must!	O

Try	O
the	O
Pad	B-A
Thai	I-A
,	O
it's	O
fabulous	O
and	O
their	O
prices	O
are	O
so	O
cheap!	O

Just	O
because	O
it's	O
cheap	O
does	O
NOT	O
mean	O
the	O
portions	B-A
	O
are	O
small	O
or	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
nasty,	O
IT	O
IS	O
GREAT!	O

Just	O
remember,	O
the	O
later	O
you	O
go,	O
the	O
longer	O
you	O
may	O
have	O
to	O
wait.	O

It's	O
popular	O
w/the	O
late	O
crowd.	O

They	O
forgot	O
a	O
sandwich,	O
didn't	O
include	O
plastic	O
forks,	O
and	O
didn't	O
include	O
pita	O
with	O
the	O
hummus	O
platter.	O

Also,	O
the	O
sandwiches	B-A
	O
(nearing	O
$7)	O
didn't	O
come	O
with	O
anything	O
like	O
chips	O
or	O
a	O
side.	O

Overall,	O
not	O
worth	O
the	O
money.	O

Eating	O
in,	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
saves	O
it,	O
but	O
at	O
your	O
desk,	O
it's	O
a	O
very	O
disappointing	O
experience.	O

I	O
love	O
Indian	O
food	O
and	O
consider	O
myself	O
to	O
be	O
quite	O
an	O

on	O
it.	O

Mermaid	B-A
Inn	I-A
	O
is	O
an	O
overall	O
good	O
restaurant	O
with	O
really	O
good	O
seafood	B-A
.	O

The	O
menu	B-A
	O
is	O
limited	O
but	O
almost	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
dishes	B-A
	O
are	O
excellent.	O

The	O
lobster	B-A

good	O
and	O
the	O
spaghetti	B-A
with	I-A
Scallops	I-A

The	O

and	O
ambience	B-A
	O
is	O
good	O
for	O
a	O

The	O
only	O
fallback	O
on	O
this	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
is	O
the	O
prices.	O

Even	O
though	O
its	O
good	O
seafood	B-A
,	O
the	O
prices	O
are	O
too	O
high.	O

The	O
lobster	B-A
sandwich	I-A
	O
is	O
$24	O
and	O
although	O
it	O
was	O
good	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
nearly	O
enough	O
to	O
warrant	O
that	O
price.	O

Went	O
to	O
Village	O
last	O
night	O
for	O
my	O
birthday.	O

We	O
picked	O
it	O
randomly,	O
without	O
a	O
recommendation	O
from	O
someone	O
who	O
has	O
been	O
there,	O
so	O
we	O
weren't	O
sure	O
what	O
to	O
expect.	O

We	O
were	O
very	O
pleasantly	O
surprised.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
delicious	O
(I	O
had	O
a	O
halibut	B-A
special	I-A
,	O
my	O
husband	O
had	O
steak	B-A
),	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
top-notch.	O

When	O
my	O
dessert	O
came,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
candle	O
in	O
it	O
-	O
not	O
because	O
anyone	O
asked	O
for	O
one	O
-	O
but	O
because	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
	O
must	O
have	O
seen	O
me	O
opening	O
my	O
birthday	O
card	O
and	O
gift,	O
and	O
said	O
he	O
knew	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
special	O
occassion	O
of	O
some	O
sort.	O

Truly	O
the	O
mark	O
of	O
an	O
attentive	O
waiter	B-A
.	O

I	O
highly	O
recommend	O
the	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
based	O
on	O
our	O
experience	O
last	O
night.	O

We	O
ate	O
at	O
this	O
Thai	O
place	O
following	O
the	O
reviews	O
but	O
very	O
unhappy	O
with	O
the	O
foods	B-A
.	O

We	O
thought	O
that	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
using	O
too	O
much	O
of	O
MSG	O
cooking	O
in	O
the	O
foods	B-A
.	O

Why?	O

They	O
don't	O
concern	O
much	O
of	O
customer's	O
health,	O
just	O
want	O
to	O
make	O
money.	O

please	O
don't	O
fool	O
us.	O

I	O
visit	O
New	O
Green	O
Bo	O
when	O
I	O
have	O
money	O
or	O
when	O
I	O
am	O
broke.	O

I	O
recommend	O
the	O
jelly	B-A
fish	I-A
,	O
drunken	B-A
chicken	I-A
	O
and	O
the	O
soupy	B-A

,	O
certainly	O
the	O
stir	B-A
fry	I-A
blue	I-A
crab	I-A

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
so	O
cheap	O
and	O
the	O
waiters	B-A
	O
are	O
nice.	O

Of	O
course,	O
it	O
is	O
crowded	O
but	O
who	O
cares.	O

Authentic	O
Shanghai	O
style	O
and	O
I	O
cannot	O
recommend	O
a	O
better	O
Shanghai	O
place	O
in	O
New	O

Have	O
frequented	O
'ino	O
for	O
several	O
years	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
remains	O
excellent.	O

Cheese	B-A
plate	I-A
	O
is	O
a	O
varied	O
delight	O
and	O
great	O

$10.	O

The	O
large	O
selection	O
of	O
bruschettas	B-A
,	O
paninis	B-A
,	O
tramezzinis	B-A
	O

(The	O

Definitely	O
a	O
neighborhood	O

I	O
loved	O
this	O
place	B-A
!!	O

I	O
almost	O
hesititate	O
to	O
write	O
a	O
review	O
because	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
was	O
so	O
great	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
hate	O
for	O
it	O
too	O
become	O
to	O
crowded.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
good,	O
a	O
great	O
deal,	O
and	O
the	O
place	B-A
	O
its	O
self	O
was	O
great.	O

The	O
wait	B-A
staff	I-A
	O
is	O
very	O
freindly,	O
they	O
make	O
it	O
feel	O
like	O
you're	O
eating	O
in	O
a	O
freindly	O
little	O
european	O
town.	O

I	O
like	O
Cafe	B-A
Noir	I-A
	O
dont	O
get	O
me	O
wrong,	O
it	O
is	O
jsut	O
that	O
the	O
people	B-A
	O
who	O
work	O
there	O
are	O
evil	O
and	O
incompetent!!	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
terrible,	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
everything	O
and	O
ask	O
several	O
of	O
different	O
people	O
for	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
before	O
we	O
were	O
allowed	O
to	O
be	O
served.	O

The	O
waitress	B-A
,	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
concerned	O
of	O
looking	O
good	O
than	O
actually	O
waitressing.	O

After	O
dinner	O
the	O
manager	B-A
	O
grabbed	O
my	O
boyfriend,	O
asked	O
him:	O
Where	O
are	O
you	O
from...maybe	O
you	O
dont	O
know	O
how	O
things	O
work	O
in	O
America...and	O
in	O
the	O
end	O
stormed	O
away	O
almost	O
teareyed	O
yelling	O
that	O
tips	O
are	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
they	O
survive	O
on.	O

We	O
did	O
tip,	O
I	O
guess	O
the	O
model/waitress	B-A
	O
just	O
wanted	O
more	O
and	O
complained	O
to	O
the	O
manager.	O

The	O
whole	O
set	O
up	O
is	O
truly	O
unprofessional	O
and	O
I	O
wish	O
Cafe	B-A
Noir	I-A
	O
would	O
get	O
some	O
good	O
staff	B-A
,	O
because	O
despite	O
the	O
current	O
one	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
place.	O

Pizza	B-A
	O
here	O
is	O
consistently	O
good.	O

Salads	B-A
	O
are	O
a	O
delicious	O
way	O
to	O
begin	O
the	O
meal.	O

You	O
should	O
pass	O
on	O
the	O
calamari	B-A
.	O

It	O
is	O
thick	O
and	O
slightly	O
soggy.	O

Decor	B-A
	O
is	O
charming.	O

Service	B-A
	O
is	O
average.	O

What	O
a	O
great	O
place	B-A
.	O

I	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
city	O
to	O
try	O
out	O
this	O
restaurant	O
because	O
a	O
friend	O
had	O
recommended	O
it	O
to	O
my	O
husband.	O

The	O
ambience	B-A
	O
was	O
so	O
fun,	O
and	O
the	O
prices	O
were	O
great,	O
on	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
really	O
tasty.	O

I	O
wasn't	O
thrilled	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
wait	O
on	O
line	O
for	O
thirty	O
minutes,	O
but	O
I	O
guess	O
that's	O
the	O
price	O
you	O
pay	O
for	O
a	O
popular	O
place.	O

I	O
would	O
definitely	O
recommend	O
SEA	O
if	O
you	O
like	O
thai	B-A
cuisine	I-A
!	O

I	O
was	O
here	O
a	O
few	O
weeks	O
back	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
worst	O
customer	B-A
service	I-A
	O
experience	O
at	O
a	O
restaurant	O
ever.	O

A	O
gentleman	B-A
,	O
maybe	O
the	O
manager,	O
came	O
to	O
our	O
table,	O
and	O
without	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
a	O
smile	O
or	O
greeting	O
asked	O
for	O
our	O
order.	O

When	O
asked	O
about	O
how	O
a	O
certain	O
dish	O
was	O
prepared	O
in	O
comparison	O
to	O
a	O
similar	O
at	O
other	O
thai	O
restaurants,	O
he	O
replied	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
Mcdonald's,	O
every	O
place	O
makes	O
things	O
differently	O

While	O
it	O
is	O
understandable	O
that	O
every	O
place	O
is	O
indeed	O
different,	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
uncourteous	O
to	O
customers	O
and	O
downright	O
rude.	O

The	O
service	O
was	O
poor,	O
restaurant	O
poorly	O
lit,	O
staff	O
not	O
very	O
attentive	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
rather	O
eaten	O
at	O
a	O
Mcdonald's	O
than	O
this	O
joint.	O

Never	O
again!	O

I	O
absolutely	O
Loved	O
this	O
place	B-A
.	O

My	O
friends	O
spoke	O
so	O
much	O
about	O
it	O
for	O
months,	O
I	O
finally	O
made	O
the	O
time	O
to	O
come	O
down	O
ear	O
and	O
dine	O
in.	O

Excellent	O
atmosphere	B-A
,	O
delicious	O

	O
good	O
and	O

this	O
is	O
can	O
became	O
on	O
e	O
of	O
the	O
NY	O

Food	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
absolutely	O
brilliant	O
and	O
well	O
runned	O
business	O
operation.	O

The	O
wine	B-A
list	I-A
	O
is	O
also	O
really	O
nice.	O

A	O
friend	O
from	O
Seattle	O
and	O
I	O
went	O
on	O
a	O
Thursday	O

around	O
8:30.	O

Everything	O
was	O
wonderful;	O

I	O
would	O
highly	O

this	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
to	O
Casimir	B-A
	O
over	O
5	O
times	O
and	O
I	O
have	O
always	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
time	O
there.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
great	O
and	O
reasonably	O
priced.	O

I	O
have	O
tried	O
to	O
make	O
reservations,	O
but	O
both	O
times,	O
the	O
hostess	B-A
	O
didn't	O
have	O
my	O
name.	O

If	O
the	O
weather	O
is	O
nice,	O
try	O
to	O
snag	O
an	O
outside	B-A
table	I-A
.	O

The	O
staff	B-A
	O
has	O
been	O
nice,	O
but	O
they	O
seemed	O
really	O
stressed	O
and	O
the	O
unisex	B-A
bathroom	I-A
	O
needs	O
to	O
be	O
cleaned	O
more	O
often.	O

My	O
boyfriend	O
and	O
I	O
went	O
there	O
to	O
celebrate	O
my	O
birthday	O
the	O
other	O
night	O
and	O
all	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
is	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
magnificent.	O

From	O
the	O
spectacular	O
caviar	B-A
	O
to	O
the	O
hospitable	O
waitstaff	B-A
,	O
I	O
felt	O
like	O
royalty	O
and	O
enjoyed	O
every	O
second	O
of	O
it.	O

Considering	O
we	O
were	O
the	O
last	O
patrons	O
there	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
after	O
the	O
closing	O
time,	O
the	O
waitstaff	B-A
	O
did	O
not	O
rush	O
us	O
at	O
all	O
and	O
made	O
us	O
feel	O
comfortable	O
and	O
relaxed.	O

I	O
highly	O
recommend	O
Caviar	O

to	O
anyone	O

Fresh	O

I	O
was	O
pleasantly	O

this	O

Friendly	O

	O
that	O

My	O
friends	O
and	O
I	O
were	O
on	O
vacation	O
in	O
NY	O
and	O
was	O
referred	O
to	O
Chance	O
by	O
a	O
friend.	O

I	O
found	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
to	O
be	O
outstanding,	O
particulary	O
the	O
salmon	B-A
dish	I-A
	O
I	O
had.	O

I	O
also	O
ordered	O
the	O
Change	B-A
Mojito	I-A
,	O
which	O
was	O
out	O
of	O
this	O
world.	O

My	O
friends	O
settled	O
for	O
rice	O
dishes,	O
but	O
we	O
came	O
back	O
the	O
following	O
day	O
to	O
try	O
the	O
dim	B-A
sum	I-A
,	O
which	O
was	O
good...not	O
outstanding,	O
but	O
good.	O

We	O
ate	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
back	B-A
patio	I-A
,	O
which	O
is	O
worth	O
it	O
as	O
it's	O
cool	O
and	O
the	O
music	B-A
	O
is	O
hear	O
well	O
there.	O

Overall,	O
excellent	O
restaurant	B-A
!	O

i	O
went	O
to	O
utsav	O
about	O
a	O
yr	O
ago	O
with	O
my	O
family.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
good.	O

The	O
place	B-A
	O
was	O
nice	O
and	O
calm.	O

but	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
a	O
bit	O
slow.	O

I	O
work	O
around	O
the	O
corner	O
and	O
tried	O
it	O
with	O
a	O
colleague	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time.	O

The	O
buffet	B-A
	O
had	O
a	O
nice	O
selection.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
average	O
or	O
above	O
including	O
some	O
surprising	O
tasty	O
dishes	B-A
.	O

Service	B-A
	O
was	O
also	O
very	O
good.	O

I	O
would	O
go	O
back.	O

I	O
got	O
an	O
excellent	O
piece	O
of	O
cheesecake	B-A
	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
several	O
other	O
nice	O
pastries	B-A
.	O

I	O
would	O
recommend	O
Roxy's	O
for	O
that,	O
but	O
not	O
for	O
their	O
food	B-A
.	O

My	O
son	O
and	O
his	O
girlfriend	O
both	O
wanted	O
cheeseburgers	B-A
	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
huge!	O

But,	O
they	O
were	O
too	O
big	O
for	O
the	O
bun.	O

Consequently,	O
their	O
burgers	B-A
	O
fell	O
apart	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O
and	O
made	O
such	O
a	O
mess	O
that	O
they	O
did'nt	O
feel	O
like	O
finishing	O
them.	O

Also	O
they	O
were	O
$15	O
each!	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
huge	O
pastrami	B-A
sandwich	I-A
on	I-A
a	I-A
roll	I-A
.	O

It	O
was	O
$14	O
not	O
really	O
bad	O
for	O
a	O
pound	O
of	O
Pastrami-but	O
it	O
didn't	O
have	O
much	O
taste-I've	O
had	O
better	O
for	O
less	O
elsewhere!	O

This	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
really	O
trendi	O
but	O
they	O
have	O
forgotten	O
about	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
part	O
of	O
a	O
	O
restaurant,	O
the	O
food	B-A
.	O

The	O
last	O
two	O
times	O
I	O
ordered	O
from	O
here	O
my	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
soo	O
spicy	O
that	O
	O
I	O
could	O
barely	O
eat	O
it,	O
and	O
the	O
spice	B-A
	O
took	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
flavor	O
of	O
the	O
dish.	O

And	O
the	O
Tom	B-A
Kha	I-A
soup	I-A
	O
was	O
pathetic.	O

If	O
you	O
want	O
good	O
authentic	O
Thai	B-A
	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
place	O
to	O
go.	O

We	O
went	O
here	O
for	O
lunch	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
weeks	O
ago	O
on	O
a	O
Saturday,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
thoroughly	O
impressed	O
with	O
the	O
food	B-A
.	O

The	O
pesto	B-A
pizza	I-A
	O
was	O
excellent,	O
thin-crust	O
pizza	O
with	O
a	O
nice	O
amount	O
of	O
spicy	B-A
Italian	I-A
cheese	I-A
	O
that	O
I'd	O
never	O
heard	O
of	O
before.	O

Conveniently	O
located	O
too,	O
being	O
right	O
on	O
Bedford	O
ave.	O

THe	O
back	B-A
garden	I-A
sitting	I-A
area	I-A
	O
is	O
very	O
pleasant,	O
where	O
you	O
can	O
see	O
their	O
personal	O
herb	O
garden.	O

I	O
will	O
definetly	O
be	O
going	O
back.	O

We	O
had	O
the	O
lobster	B-A
sandwich	I-A
	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
FANTASTIC.	O

My	O
husband	O
said	O
he	O
could've	O
eaten	O
several	O
more,	O
the	O
portion	B-A
	O
was	O
fine	O
for	O
me	O
he	O
even	O
exclaimed	O
that	O
the	O
french	B-A
fries	I-A
	O
were	O
the	O
best	O
he	O
has	O
had.	O

We	O
had	O
the	O
scallops	B-A
	O
as	O
an	O
appetizer	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
delicious	O
and	O
the	O
sauce	B-A
	O
was	O
wonderful.	O

I	O
recommend	O
getting	O
a	O
reservation	O
even	O
though	O
we	O
saw	O
people	O
seated	O
without	O
one.	O

We	O
waited	O
at	O
the	O
bar	O
and	O
had	O
martinis	B-A
	O
that	O
were	O
just	O
right.	O

We	O
will	O
be	O
back.	O

love	O
the	O

I've	O

	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
rare	O

We	O
have	O
tried	O
every	O

and	O
4th	O
Streets,	O
and	O
Joya	O

very	O

A	O

The	O

	O
was	O

and	O
the	O

	O
was	O

We	O
are	O
very	O
particular	O
about	O

Overall	O
the	O

is	O
more	O

than	O
our	O

favorites,	O
but	O
everything	O
was	O
delicious.	O

Definitely	O
a	O
great	O

	O
for	O

Average	O
to	O

,	O
but	O
terrible	O
delivery	B-A
.	O

I've	O
waited	O
over	O
one	O
hour	O
for	O
food.	O

They	O
were	O
very	O
abrupt	O
with	O
me	O
when	O
I	O
called	O
and	O
actually	O
claimed	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
late	O
because	O
they	O
were	O
out	O
of	O
rice.	O

A	O
Thai	B-A
restaurant	I-A
	O
out	O
of	O
rice	O
during	O
dinner?	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
arrived	O
20	O
minutes	O
after	O
I	O
called,	O
cold	O
and	O
soggy.	O

i	O
actually	O
feel	O
like	O
i	O
should	O
keep	O
it	O
a	O
secret.	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
wonderful	O
place	B-A
	O
on	O

An	O

Went	O
to	O
Cafe	O
Spice	O
with	O
4	O
of	O
my	O
friends	O
on	O
a	O
saturday	O
night.	O

We	O
were	O
greeted	O
promptly	O
by	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
	O
who	O
was	O
very	O
nice	O
and	O
cordial.	O

She	O
was	O
very	O
helpful	O
in	O
suggesting	O
us	O
drinks	O
and	O
helped	O
us	O
in	O
ordering	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
good	O
dishes	B-A
	O
since	O
we	O
knew	O
nothing	O
about	O
Indian	O
food.	O

We	O
were	O
fast	O
to	O
order	O
the	O
appetizer	O
platter	O
since	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
hungry.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
looked	O
very	O

and	O
delicious	O
since	O
it	O
came	O
on	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
fancy	O
plates.	O

We	O
ended	O
our	O
great	O
experience	O
by	O
having	O
Gulab	B-A
Jamun	I-A
(dessert)	I-A
	O
recommended	O
by	O
the	O
waiter.	O

I	O
thanked	O
my	O
friend	O
who	O
recommended	O
me	O
this	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
and	O
will	O
certainly	O
recommend	O
it	O
to	O
others.	O

I	O
went	O
here	O
with	O
a	O
friend	O
on	O
a	O
whim,	O
we	O
went	O
someplace	O
else	O
first	O
and	O
couldn't	O
get	O
a	O
table.	O

Service	B-A
	O
here	O
was	O
great,	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
fantastic.	O

Guacamole+shrimp	B-A
appetizer	I-A
	O
was	O
really	O
great,	O
we	O
both	O
had	O
the	O
filet	B-A
,	O
very	O
good,	O
didn't	O
much	O
like	O
the	O
frites	B-A
	O
that	O
came	O
with,	O
but	O
the	O
filet	O
was	O
so	O
good,	O
neither	O
of	O
us	O
cared.	O

Will	O
absolutely	O
visit	O
again.	O

Maybe	O
tomorrow	O
;-)	O

You	O
cannot	O
go	O
wrong	O
with	O
this	O
place	B-A
.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
outstanding	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
quick,	O
friendly	O
and	O
very	O
professional.	O

Always	O
a	O
nice	O
crowd	B-A
,	O
but	O
never	O
loud.	O

Go	O
here.	O

Good	O
for	O
dates	O
or	O
with	O
friends.	O

I	O
am	O
reluctant	O
to	O
write	O
because	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
want	O
my	O
jem	O
of	O
a	O
pizza	B-A
place	I-A
	O
to	O
become	O
overcrowded.	O

However,	O
it	O
is	O
jus	O
too	O
good	O
to	O
not	O
praise	O
it.	O

By	O
far,	O
the	O
best	O
pizza	B-A
	O
in	O
Manhattan.	O

The	O
crust	B-A
	O
is	O
thin,	O
the	O
ingredients	B-A
	O
are	O
fresh	O
and	O
the	O
staff	B-A
	O
is	O
friendly.	O

For	O
all	O
you	O
lazy	O
folks	O
that	O
don't	O
want	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
Alphabet	O
City,	O
I	O
say,	O
good	O
-	O
stay	O
out.	O

less	O
wait	O
time	O
for	O
me!	O

We	O
arrived	O
on	O
time	O
for	O
our	O
reservation	O
and	O
seated	O
promptly.	O

The	O
menu	B-A
	O
has	O
so	O
many	O
fish	O
items	O
and	O
oysters.	O

We	O
all	O
ordered	O
different	O
entrees	O
so	O
we	O
could	O
share.	O

The	O
fish	B-A
	O
was	O
really,really	O
fresh.	O

I	O
lived	O
in	O
Maine	O
for	O
ten	O
years	O
and	O
grew	O
up	O
on	O
fish.	O

We	O
all	O
agreed	O
that	O
mare	B-A
	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
seafood	O
restaurants	O
in	O
New	O
York.	O

I	O
stumbled	O
upon	O
this	O
great	O
pizzeria	B-A
	O
as	O
I	O
explored	O
my	O
new	O
neighborhood.	O

All	O
of	O
the	O
pizzas	B-A
	O
are	O
terrific	O
and	O
the	O
price	O
is	O
even	O
better!	O

I	O
highly	O
recommend	O
the	O
Sophia	B-A
pizza	I-A
.	O

It's	O
to	O
die	O
for!	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
mediocre	O
at	O
best	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
horrible	O
service	B-A
	O
that	O
made	O
me	O
vow	O
never	O
to	O
go	O
back.	O

Immediately	O
after	O
we	O
paid,	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
	O
took	O
the	O
money	O
and	O
said,	O
okay,	O
you	O
guys	O
are	O
outta	O
here.	O

There	O
are	O
other	O
people	O
waiting!	O

We	O
weren't	O
even	O
at	O
our	O
table	O
for	O
more	O
than	O
an	O
hour	O
total.	O

As	O
we	O
were	O
leaving,	O
the	O
couple	O
standing	O
by	O
the	O
door	O
said	O
to	O
another	O
waiter,	O
we're	O
not	O
in	O
a	O
hurry.	O

Our	O
friends	O
have	O
not	O
arrived	O
yet.	O

So	O
rushing	O
us	O
out	O
was	O
absolutely	O
unnecessary!	O

For	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
want	O
great	O
food	B-A
	O
plus	O
great	O
service	B-A
,	O
Roxy	O
is	O
a	O
place	O
to	O
AVOID!	O

I've	O
been	O
here	O
twice	O
now.	O

The	O
first	O
time	O
the	O
sushi	B-A
	O
was	O
outstanding,	O
the	O
second	O
time	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
bland.	O

I'm	O
sure	O
I'll	O
return	O
for	O
a	O
final	O
judgement	O
tho.	O

The	O
blond	B-A
wood	I-A
decor	I-A
	O
is	O
very	O
soothing,	O
the	O
premium	B-A

and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O

you,	O
but	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
doesn't	O
quite	O

up.	O

I	O
ordered	O
the	O
smoked	B-A
salmon	I-A
and	I-A
roe	I-A
appetizer	I-A
	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
off	O

The	O
entree	B-A
	O
was	O
bland	O
and	O
small,	O
dessert	B-A
	O
was	O
not	O

I	O
expected	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O
more	O
from	O
such	O
an	O
expensive	O
menu	B-A
.	O

The	O
view	B-A

and	O
the	O

	O
is	O
great.	O

Wonderful	O

that's	O

what	O

(Besides	O

Delicious	O
crab	B-A

	O
too.	O

Even	O
if	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
wasn't	O
this	O
good,	O
the	O
garden	B-A
	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
place	O
to	O
sit	O

This	O

of	I-A

	O
including	O
the	O

Their	O
calzones	B-A
	O
are	O
horrific,	O
bad,	O

YUCK.	O

They	O
smell	O
like	O
they	O
stuff	O
them	O
with	O
old	O

like	O
the	O

The	O

They	O

They're	O

NO	O
PIZZA	B-A

	O
for	O
me!	O

Anybody	O
who	O
likes	O
this	O
place	O
must	O
be	O
from	O
a	O
different	O
planet,	O
where	O
greasy,	O
dry	O
and	O
tasteless	O
are	O
complimentary.	O

The	O
dosas	B-A
	O
are	O
skimpy,	O
unattractive	O
and	O
drip	O
with	O
grease,	O
and	O
personally	O
I'd	O
drink	O
popcorn	O
topping	O
before	O
I'd	O
eat	O
another	O
one	O
of	O
these.	O

The	O
sandwiches	B-A
	O
are	O
dry,	O
tasteless	O
and	O
way	O
overpriced.	O

Calling	O

Co.	O
does	O
warn	O
you	O
that	O
these	O
folks	O
offer	O
more	O
style	O
than	O
substance,	O
but	O
in	O
this	O
unattractive	O
room	B-A
	O
with	O
unhelpful	O
clerks	B-A
	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
dearth	O
of	O
the	O
former	O
too.	O

Seriously,	O
this	O
place	B-A
	O
kicks	O
ass.	O

The	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
is	O
unheralded,	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
impecible,	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O

Best	O
Italian	B-A
food	I-A
	O
I	O
ever	O
had	O
(and	O
being	O
Italian,	O
that	O
means	O
alot).	O

It	O
is	O
nearly	O
impossible	O
to	O
get	O
a	O

so	O
if	O
you	O
ever	O
have	O
the	O

here	O
for	O

DO	O

This	O
is	O
such	O
a	O
lovely,	O
peaceful	O
place	B-A
	O

beautiful	O
green	O

to	O
the	O
Hudson	O

the	O

It	O

and	O
there	O
is	O

The	O

their	O
more	O
basic	B-A
dishes	I-A

and	O
the	O

	O
are	O

This	O
is	O
a	O

	O
to	O

I	O

spot	O
every	O

This	O
tiny	O
Williamsburg	B-A
spot	I-A
	O
is	O
always	O
pleasantly	O
surprising.	O

The	O
pizza	B-A
	O
is	O
delicious	O
and	O
the	O
proprietor	B-A
	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
nicest	O
in	O

Even	O
the	O
pasta	O
is	O
delicious	O
here	O
(a	O
rarity	O
in	O
New	O

pizza	O
restaurants).	O

I've	O
been	O
many	O
time	O
and	O
have	O
never	O
been	O
disappointed.	O

Compared	O
to	O
Ess-a,	O
Tal	O
offers	O
a	O
less	O
doughy	O
bagel!	O

They	O
even	O
scoop	O
it	O
out	O
nice	O
(for	O
those	O
on	O
a	O
diet)	O
not	O
too	O
much	O
not	O
to	O

The	O
cream	B-A

	O
are	O
out	O
of	O
this	O

and	O
I	O
love	O
that	O
coffee	B-A
!!	O

A	O
little	O
crowded	O
but	O
they	O
move	O
that	O
line	O
really	O
fast!	O

A	O
little	O
pricey	O
but	O
it	O
really	O
hits	O

on	O
a	O
Sunday	O

Bagels	B-A
	O
are	O
ok,	O
but	O
be	O
sure	O
not	O
to	O
make	O
any	O
special	O

I	O
asked	O
for	O
an	O
open	O
faced	O
cheese	O
sandwich	O
and	O
the	O
manager	B-A
	O
basically	O
told	O
me	O
to	O
take	O
my	O
business	O
elsewhere!	O

Be	O
sure	O
not	O
to	O
get	O
anything	O
other	O
than	O
bagels	B-A
!..	O

the	O
turkey	B-A
burgers	I-A
	O
are	O
scary!	O

The	O
worst	O
excuse	O
for	O
Japanese	O
food	O
I've	O
ever	O
encountered.	O

The	O
soup	B-A
for	I-A
the	I-A
udon	I-A
	O
was	O
soy	O
sauce	O
and	O
water.	O

The	O
sushi	B-A
	O
was	O
awful!	O

The	O
rice	B-A
	O
was	O
poor	O
quality	O
and	O
was	O
cooked	O
so	O
badly	O
it	O
was	O
hard.	O

Furthermore,	O
the	O
rice	B-A
	O
had	O
no	O
seasoning,	O
so	O
the	O
sushi	B-A
	O
was	O
bland	O
and	O
disgusting.	O

The	O
fish	B-A
	O
was	O
adequate,	O
but	O
inexpertly	O
sliced.	O

It	O
is	O
obvious	O
that	O
no	O
one	O
in	O
the	O
restaurant	O
has	O
any	O
idea	O
about	O
or	O
experience	O
with	O
Japanese	B-A
cuisine	I-A
.	O

Good,	O
fast	O
service	B-A
.	O

I	O
would	O
highly	O
recommend.	O

Food	B-A
	O
is	O
great	O
and	O
inexpensive.	O

The	O
location	B-A
	O
is	O
perfect.	O

Give	O
it	O
a	O
try	O
and	O
enjoy.	O

I	O
thought	O
going	O
to	O
Jimmys	O
would	O
give	O
me	O
a	O
real	O
Domincan	O
exprience.	O

Jimmy	O
is	O
Dominican!	O

Well,	O
this	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
so	O
Ghetto	O
its	O
not	O
even	O
funny.	O

If	O
you	O
like	O
your	O
music	B-A
	O
blasted	O
and	O
the	O
system	O
isnt	O
that	O
great	O
and	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
pay	O

her	O

the	O

you.	O

The	O

For	O

to	O
many	O

in	O
Manhattan	O

the	O

Ive	O
had	O
(except	O

Try	O

...they're	O
all	O
delicious.	O

Everything	O
about	O
this	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
was	O
special.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
attentive,	O
yet	O
discreet.	O

The	O
flavors	O
robust	O
and	O
subtle.	O

The	O
brioche	B-A

is	O
a	O
cute	O
and	O

touch	O
to	O
a	O
most	O
memorable	O
meal.	O

I'm	O
saving	O
up	O
for	O

I	O
went	O
there	O
in	O
late	O
afternoon	O
for	O
some	O
bite	O
size	O

and	O
refleshment	O
with	O

The	O
place	B-A
	O
was	O
quiet	O
and	O
delightful.	O

Service	B-A
	O
was	O
good	O
and	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
wonderful.	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
try	O
the	O
caviar	O
but	O
I	O
tried	O
their	O
salmon	B-A
	O
and	O
crab	B-A
salad	I-A
	O
(they	O
are	O
all	O
good)	O
	O
	O

It	O
is	O
definitely	O
a	O
good	O
spot	B-A
	O
for	O
snacks	O
and	O
chat.	O

As	O
a	O
retired	O
hipster,	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
with	O
some	O
degree	O
of	O
certainty	O
that	O
for	O
the	O
last	O
year	O
Lucky	B-A
Strike	I-A
	O
has	O
been	O
the	O
best	O
laid-back	O
late	O
night	O
in	O
the	O
city.	O

The	O
wait	B-A
staff	I-A
	O
is	O
pleasant,	O
fun,	O
and	O
for	O
the	O
most	O
part	O
gorgeous	O
(in	O
the	O
wonderful	O
aesthetic	O
beautification	O
way,	O
not	O
in	O
that	O
she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$*	O
way).	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
yummy,	O
especially	O
their	O
cooked-to-perfection	O
mussels	B-A
in	I-A
spicy	I-A
tomato	I-A
sauce	I-A
	O
and	O
their	O
shoestring	O
crispy	O
fries	B-A
.	O

But	O
the	O
best	O
part	O
about	O
LS	O
is	O
the	O
late	B-A
night	I-A
atmosphere	I-A
,	O
delightfully	O
free	O
of	O
the	O
BTs.	O

You	O
can	O
get	O
a	O
completely	O
delish	O
martini	B-A
	O
in	O
a	O
glass	O
(that's	O
about	O
2	O

for	O
$8.50	O
(I	O
recommend	O
the	O
Vanilla	B-A
Shanty	I-A
,	O
mmmm!)	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
homey	O
setting	B-A
	O

The	O

DJ	I-A
	O
on	O
Saturday	O
nights	O
has	O
outrageously	O
good	O
taste	O
in	O
music,	O
and	O
moreover,	O
takes	O
requests.	O

You	O
can't	O
go	O
wrong	O
with	O
this	O
place	B-A
.	O

Suan	B-A
	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
place	O
that	O
I	O
often	O
take	O
my	O
friends	O
(classmates)	O
too.	O

Its	O
location	B-A
	O
is	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
Hutner	O
College	O
is	O
near	O
and	O
their	O
prices	O
are	O
very	O
reasonable,	O
makes	O
students	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
Suan	B-A
	O
again	O
and	O
again.	O

I	O
LOVE	O
their	O
Thai	B-A
	O

noodles	B-A
with	I-A
shrimp	I-A
and	I-A
chicken	I-A
and	I-A
coconut	I-A
juice	I-A
	O
is	O
the	O
MUST!	O

I	O
was	O
in	O
love	O
with	O
Pongsri	O
on	O
48th,	O
but	O
compared	O
to	O
Suan	O
it	O
is	O
slow	O
in	O
service	O
and	O
overpriced.	O

I	O
will	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
Suan	B-A
	O
soon!	O

In	O
summer-eat	O
outside	O
on	O
a	O
terrace	B-A
	O
(another	O
great	O

of	O
Suan)!!!	O

I	O
cannot	O
imagine	O
a	O
friendlier	O
staff	B-A
	O
working	O
in	O
a	O
restaurant.	O

I	O
cannot	O
imagine	O
better	O
Indian	B-A
food	I-A
	O
in	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
city.	O

I	O
cannot	O
imagine	O
you	O
not	O
rushing	O
out	O
to	O
eat	O
there.	O

This	O
restaurant	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
our	O
regular	O
Thursday	O
night	O
dinner	O
location.	O

During	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
the	O
past	O
3	O
months,	O
the	O
chef	B-A
	O
and	O
staff	B-A
	O
changed	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
for	O
the	O
better.	O

I	O
wish	O
they	O
would	O
change	O
back	O
to	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
before.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
now	O
is	O
inconsistent.	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
kind	O
of	O
place	B-A
	O
you'd	O
like	O
to	O
take	O
all	O
your	O
friends	O
to	O
and	O
still	O
keep	O
a	O
secret.	O

The	O
setting	B-A
	O
is	O
casual	O
and	O
romantic.	O

Prices	O
are	O
very	O
good.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
excellent!	O
	O

if	O
you're	O
daring,	O
try	O
the	O
balsamic	B-A
vinegar	I-A
over	I-A
icecream	I-A
,	O
it's	O
wonderful!	O

Do	O
not	O
get	O
the	O
Go	B-A
Go	I-A
Hamburgers	I-A
,	O
no	O
matter	O
what	O
the	O
reviews	O
say.	O

They	O
were	O
such	O
a	O
rip-off	O
($8.95	O
for	O
four	O
small	O
meat	O
patties	O
in	O
steamed	O
buns)	O
and	O
not	O
worth	O
trying.	O

The	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
dim	B-A
sum	I-A
,	O
though	O
pricey	O
by	O
Chinatown	O
standards,	O
is	O
worth	O
it.	O

Steamed	O
fresh	O
so	O
brought	O
hot	O
hot	O
hot	O
to	O
your	O
table.	O

The	O
wait	B-A
	O
here	O
is	O
long	O
for	O
dim	O
sum,	O
but	O
if	O
you	O
don't	O
like	O
sharing	O
tables	O
or	O
if	O
the	O
typical	O
raucous	O
dim	O
sum	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
is	O
not	O
your	O
gig,	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
sleek	O
(for	O
Chinatown)	O
alternative.	O

A	O
few	O
tips:	O
skip	O
the	O
turnip	B-A
cake	I-A
,	O
roast	B-A
pork	I-A
buns	I-A
	O
and	O
egg	B-A
custards	I-A
.	O

These	O
are	O
overpriced	O
and	O
you	O
can	O
get	O
better	O
just	O
around	O
the	O
corner:	O

(1)	O
turnip	O
cakes	O
at	O
the	O
little	O
kiosk	O
on	O
east	O
side	O
of	O
Mott	O
St.	O
just	O
south	O
of	O

(2)	O

either	O

After	O
passing	O
by	O
this	O
restaurant	O
for	O
sometime	O
I	O
finally	O
decided	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
and	O
have	O
dinner.	O

I	O
was	O
pleasantly	O
suprised.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
exceptional.	O

The	O
menu	O
consisted	O
of	O
standard	O
brassiere	O
food,	O
better	O
then	O
places	O
like	O
Balthazar	O
etc.	O

I	O
choose	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
special,	O
the	O
braised	B-A
lamb	I-A
shank	I-A
in	I-A
red	I-A
wine	I-A
,	O
which	O
was	O
excellent.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
friendly	O
and	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
was	O
casual.	O

The	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
is	O
a	O
bit	O
noisy	O
but	O
that	O
is	O
something	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
overlooked	O
once	O
you	O
sit	O
down	O
and	O
enjoy	O
a	O
great	O
meal	B-A
	O

this	O
little	O
place	B-A
	O
has	O
a	O
cute	O
interior	B-A
decor	I-A
	O
and	O
affordable	O
city	O
prices.	O

the	O
pad	B-A
se	I-A
ew	I-A
chicken	I-A
	O
was	O
delicious,	O
however	O
the	O
pad	B-A
thai	I-A
	O
was	O
far	O
too	O
oily.	O

i	O
would	O
just	O
ask	O
for	O
no	O
oil	O
next	O
time.	O

Have	O
eaten	O
at	O
Ginger	B-A
House	I-A
	O
several	O
times,	O
and	O
it's	O
always	O
good.	O

The	O
fried	B-A
dumplings	I-A
	O
are	O
GREAT!	O

Finally	O
a	O
reliable	O
Chinese	B-A
restaurant	I-A
!	O

This	O
place	O
would	O
be	O
so	O
much	O
better	O
served	O
by	O
being	O
run	O
by	O
a	O
group	O
that	O
actually	O
understands	O
customer	B-A
service	I-A
.	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
here	O
is	O
walk	O
in	O
and	O
eat	O
..	O
but	O
planning	O
an	O
event,	O
especially	O
a	O
small,	O
intimate	O
one,	O
forget	O
about	O
it.	O

They	O
are	O
not	O
helpful	O
in	O
the	O
least	O
and	O
will	O
give	O
you	O
the	O
grand	O
run	O
around	O
so	O
by	O
the	O
time	O
the	O
event	O
date	O
rolls	O
around	O
you	O
will	O
not	O
only	O
regret	O
chosing	O
this	O
place,	O
but	O
also	O
become	O
hostile!	O

Nobody	O
at	O
this	O
restaurant	O
will	O
give	O
firm	O
answers	O
about	O
anything	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
end,	O
not	O
one	O
person	O
takes	O
responsibility	O
for	O
anything.	O

Terrible,	O
terrible	O
management	B-A
	O
-	O
deserves	O
to	O
be	O
shut-down.	O

Never	O
fails	O
to	O
please.	O

delicious	O
bagels	B-A
,	O
especially	O
when	O
right	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
oven.	O

Spreads	B-A
	O
and	O
toppings	B-A
	O
are	O
great	O
-	O
though	O
a	O
bit	O
pricey.	O

Service	B-A
	O
is	O
fast	O
and	O
friendly.	O

Only	O
drawback	O
-	O
they	O
won't	O
toast	O
your	O
bagel,	O
and	O
they	O
don't	O
make	O
eggs	O
for	O
the	O
bagel.	O

But	O
that	O
is	O
highly	O
forgivable.	O

Been	O
there,	O
done	O
that,	O
and	O
New	O
York,	O
it's	O
not	O
that	O
big	O
a	O
deal.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
decent	O
at	O
best,	O
and	O
the	O
ambience	B-A
,	O
well,	O
it's	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
opinion,	O
some	O
may	O
consider	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
sweet	O
thing,	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
annoying.	O

If	O
celebrities	O
make	O
you	O
sweat,	O
then	O
your	O
in	O
for	O
a	O
ride,	O
but	O
if	O
your	O
like	O
most	O
around	O
these	O
parts	O
then	O
you'll	O
just	O
yawn	O
and	O
wonder	O
whats	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
hype.	O

Rao	B-A
	O
is	O
a	O
good	O
restaurant,	O
but	O
it's	O
nothing	O
special.	O

I've	O
eaten	O
at	O
many	O
different	O
Indian	O
restaurants.	O

But	O
after	O
last	O
night,	O
Spice	O
Grill	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
place	O
I'm	O
eating	O
indian	B-A
cuisine	I-A
.	O

You	O
must	O
try	O
the	O
shrimp	B-A
appetizers	I-A
.	O

Even	O
my	O
Indian	O
friend	O
couldn't	O
believe	O
how	O
good	O
and	O
tasty	O
everything	O
was.	O

This	O
place	O
has	O
the	O
the	O
correct	O
ambience	B-A
	O
and	O
an	O
excellent	O
staff	B-A
	O
to	O
make	O
you	O
feel	O
like	O
a	O
guest	O
and	O
a	O
friend	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time.	O

Great	O
food	B-A
,	O
great	O

great	O

.	O

If	O
you	O
are	O
looking	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
quality,	O
cheap	O
eats	B-A
	O
-	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
place.	O

it's	O
a	O
perfect	O
place	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
amanzing	O
indian	B-A
food	I-A
.	O

I	O
really	O
loved	O
the	O
different	O
and	O
inovated	O
touch	O
that's	O
the	O
cheff	B-A
	O
gives	O
to	O
the	O
food.	O

also	O
it's	O
great	O
to	O
have	O
dinner	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
romantic	O
and	O
confortable	O
place	B-A
,	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
it's	O
just	O
perfect...they're	O
so	O
frendly	O
that	O
we	O
never	O
want	O
to	O
live	O
the	O
place!	O

I	O
love	O
Ess-a-bagel,	O
but	O
I	O
live	O
on	O
the	O
west	O
side,	O
so	O
I	O
often	O
go	O
to	O
Murray's	O
for	O
convenience.	O

Their	O
bagels	B-A
	O
are	O
fine,	O
but	O
they	O
are	O
a	O
little	O
overcooked,	O
and	O
not	O
really	O
a	O
'special'	O
bagel	O
experience.	O

Better	O
than	O
the	O
bagel	O
shop	O
on	O
the	O
corner,	O
but	O
not	O
worth	O
going	O
out	O
of	O
your	O
way	O
for,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion.	O

Also	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
expensive	O
than	O
your	O
average	O
bagel	O
place.	O

Great	O
bagels	B-A
	O
made	O
the	O
old-fashioned	O
way.	O

The	O
appetizing	O
is	O
excellent	O
-	O
just	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
Zabars	O
Barney	O
Greengrass	O
at	O
a	O
reasonable	O
price	O
(if	O
bought	O
by	O
the	O
pound).	O

Drawbacks:	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
slow	O
and	O
they	O
don't	O
toast!	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
absolutely	O
amazing!!	O

The	O
baked	B-A
clams	I-A
octopus	I-A
	O
we	O
shared	O
as	O
appetizers	O
were	O
the	O
best	O
we've	O
ever	O
had!!	O
	O

The	O
lamb	B-A
	O
was	O
tender	O
so	O
full	O
of	O
flavor,	O
the	O
dessert	B-A
	O
was	O
divine!!	O

The	O
waiter	B-A
	O
was	O
attentive.	O

The	O
place	B-A
	O
itself	O
is	O
beautiful	O
the	O

scene	I-A
	O
seems	O

it!	O

Out	O
of	O
the	O
hundreds	O
of	O
Italian	O

in	O
Queens,	O
this	O
is	O
among	O
the	O
best.	O

The	O
shrimp	B-A
scampi	I-A
	O
was	O
excellent	O
and	O
the	O
antipasti	B-A
	O
were	O
plentiful.	O

It	O
is	O
expensive	O
but	O
well	O
worth	O
the	O
money.	O

If	O
you	O
venture	O
off	O
the	O

can't	O
seem	O
to	O
find	O
a	O
great	O
Italian	O
restaurant,	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
more	O
wonderful	O
than	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
(which	O
is	O
exceptional)	O
is	O
the	O
service	B-A
.	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
the	O
waiters	B-A
	O
don't	O
do	O
for	O
you	O
is	O
wipe	O
your	O

when	O

Service	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
prompt	O
but	O
slightly	O
rushed.	O

Food	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
good,	O
but	O
not	O
what	O
I	O
would	O
consider	O
out	O
of	O
this	O
world.	O

Go	O
here	O
for	O
a	O
romantic	O
dinner	O
but	O
not	O
for	O
an	O
all	O
out	O
wow	O
dining	O
experience.	O

My	O
friend	O
from	O
Milan	O
and	O
myself	O
were	O
pleasantly	O
surprised	O
when	O
we	O
arrived	O
and	O
everyone	O
spoke	O
italian.	O

Too	O
bad	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
wasn't	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
heritage.	O

The	O
porcini	B-A
mushroom	I-A
pasta	I-A
special	I-A
	O
was	O
tasteless,	O
so	O
was	O
the	O
seafood	B-A
tagliatelle	I-A
.	O

A	O
real	O
dissapointment.	O

But	O
that	O
wasn't	O
the	O
icing	O
on	O
the	O
cake:	O
a	O
tiramisu	B-A
	O
that	O
resembled	O
nothing	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
had.	O

They	O
should	O
have	O
called	O
it	O
mascarpone	O
with	O
chocolate	O
chips-good	O
but	O
a	O
far	O
cry	O
from	O
what	O
the	O
name	O
implies.	O

Priced	O
at	O
upper	O
intermediate	O
range.	O

I	O
really	O
liked	O
this	O
place	B-A
.	O

Everything	O
I	O
had	O
was	O
good,	O
and	O
I'm	O
a	O
eater.	O

It	O
was	O
pretty	O
inexpensive	O
too.	O

This	O
place	O
has	O
the	O
best	O
Chinese	O
style	O
BBQ	B-A
ribs	I-A
	O
in	O
the	O
city.	O

I	O
also	O
recommend	O
the	O

dishes	I-A
	O
or	O
the	O
different	O
varieties	O
of	O
congee	B-A
(rice	I-A

It's	O
great	O
to	O
go	O
for	O
a	O
quick	O
lunch	O
either	O
alone	O
or	O
with	O
a	O
friend.	O

It's	O
definately	O
not	O
a	O
place	B-A
	O
to	O
go	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
impress	O
someone.	O

However,	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
great	O
food	B-A
	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
price	O
and	O
don't	O
mind	O
the	O
decor	B-A
,	O
you	O
can't	O
beat	O
this	O

Quick	O
and	O

This	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
comfort	O
food	O
places	O
in	O
the	O
city.	O

It's	O
somewhere	O
you	O
can	O
eat	O
and	O
be	O
happy.	O

When	O
I'm	O
feeling	O
stressed	O
by	O
the	O
noise	O
and	O

around	O
my	O

I	O

When	O

	O
(which	O

you'd	O
never	O

The	O

	O
is	O
wonderful,	O
tasty	O
and	O
filling,	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
professional	O
and	O

I	O
can't	O
wait	O
for	O
summer,	O
when	O
they	O

outside	O

Ahhh...	O

I	O
recently	O
tried	O
Suan	B-A
	O
and	O
I	O
thought	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
great.	O

This	O
little	O
place	B-A
	O
definitely	O
exceeded	O
my	O
expectations	O
and	O
you	O
sure	O
get	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
food	B-A
	O
for	O
your	O
money.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
fast	O
and	O
friendly	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
tasty	O
and	O
they	O
had	O
the	O
best	O
hot	B-A
sauce	I-A
	O
to	O
add	O
to	O
your	O
meals.	O

I	O
have	O
to	O

that	O
I	O
am	O
pleasantly	O

I	O
will	O

about	O
the	O

We	O
were	O
less	O

While	O
the	O

the	O

	O
and	O

	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
a	O

better.	O

We	O

Thanks	O
Bloom's	B-A
	O
for	O
a	O
lovely	O
trip.	O

As	O
a	O
fan	O
of	O
Thai,	O
I	O
have	O
tried	O
quite	O
a	O
few	O
different	O
restaurants	O
in	O
NYC	O
and	O
this	O
one	O
was	O
definitely	O
the	O
worst.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
not	O
fresh,	O
the	O
sauces	B-A
	O
were	O
bland	O
and	O
very	O
oily.	O

It	O
just	O
wasn't	O
Thai.	O

Went	O
to	O
Ottimo	O
and	O
was	O
expecting	O
outstanding	O
pizza	O
(as	O
I	O
love	O
La	O
Pizza	O
Fresca).	O

Was	O
surprisingly	O
disappointed.	O

Pizza	B-A
	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
soggy.	O

Ravioli	B-A
	O
was	O
good...but	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
I	O
found	O
everything	O
a	O
bit	O
overpriced.	O

Not	O
enough	O
wines	B-A
by	I-A
the	I-A
glass	I-A
	O
either.	O

Service	B-A
,	O
however,	O
was	O
excellent...and	O
I	O
liked	O
the	O
setting/atmosphere	B-A
	O
a	O
lot.	O
	O

Food	B-A
	O
was	O
just	O
average...if	O
they	O
lowered	O
the	O
prices	O
just	O
a	O
bit,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
bigger	O
draw.	O

This	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
bargain.	O

Authentic	O
Pakistani	B-A
food	I-A
.	O

People	B-A
	O
are	O

The	O

The	O

	O
is	O
just	O
as	O
good.	O

bottles	B-A
of	I-A
wine	I-A
	O
are	O
cheap	O
and	O
good.	O

What	O
more	O
could	O
you	O
want?	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
actually	O
aweful.	O

I'm	O
not	O
picky	O
-	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
actually	O
gross.	O

The	O
mussles	B-A
	O
were	O
the	O
fishiest	O
things	O
I've	O
ever	O
tasted,	O
the	O

bland,	O
the	O

the	O

the	O
penne	B-A
w/	I-A
chicken	I-A
	O
had	O
bones	O
in	O
it...	O
It	O
was	O
disgusting.	O

Nice	O
atmosphere	B-A
,	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
pleasant	O
and	O
the	O
desert	B-A
	O
was	O
good.	O

Wouldn't	O
recomend	O
it	O
for	O

This	O
is	O
the	O

The	O

We	O
recently	O

this	O
location,	O
and	O
to	O
our	O
delight,	O
they	O
have	O
outdoor	B-A
seating	I-A
,	O
perfect	O
since	O
I	O
had	O
my	O
yorkie	O
with	O
me.	O

Indoor	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
cozy	O
and	O
cute.	O

The	O
portion	B-A
sizes	I-A
	O
here	O
are	O
huge,	O
and	O
the	O
sushi	B-A
	O
is	O
good.	O

While	O
it's	O
not	O
Nobu,	O
it	O
sure	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
and	O
you	O
definitely	O
will	O
leave	O
feeling	O
satisfied	O
and	O
full.	O

Staff	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
accomodating.	O

Excellent	O

dim	I-A
sum	I-A

,	O
every	O
bite	O
of	O
which	O
was	O
great.	O

But	O
$1	O
for	O
each	O
small	O
piece???	O

Not	O
worth	O
it.	O

I	O
won't	O
go	O
back	O
unless	O
someone	O
else	O
is	O
footing	O
the	O
bill.	O

I	O
came	O
here	O
with	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
for	O
our	O

because	O
it	O
was	O
highly	O
recommended	O
to	O
him	O
by	O
a	O

The	O
decor	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
simple	O
but	O
comfortable.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
delicious	O
but	O
do	O
not	O
come	O
here	O
on	O
a	O
empty	O
stomach.	O

The	O
portions	B-A
	O
are	O
small	O
but	O
being	O
that	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
so	O
good	O
makes	O
up	O
for	O
that.	O

You	O

The	O

I	O

it	O

We	O

and	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
	O
spilled	O
red	O
wine	O
and	O
hot	O

on	O
myself	O
and	O
my	O

We	O
were	O

One	O
would	O
think	O
we'd	O
get	O
an	O
apology	O
or	O
complimentary	O

-	O
instead,	O
we	O
got	O
a	O
snobby	O
waiter	B-A
	O
wouldn't	O
even	O
take	O
our	O
order	O
for	O
15	O
minutes	O
and	O
gave	O
us	O

when	O
we	O
asked	O
him	O
to	O
do	O
so.	O

We	O
left,	O
never	O

With	O
so	O
many	O
good	O
restaurants	O
on	O
the	O
UWS,	O
I	O
don't	O
need	O
overpriced	O
food	B-A
,	O
absurdly	O
arrogant	O
wait-staff	B-A
	O
who	O
don't	O
recognize	O
they	O
work	O
at	O
a	O
glorified	O
diner,	O
clumsy	O
service	B-A
,	O
and	O
management	B-A
	O
that	O
doesn't	O
care.	O

I	O
am	O
relatively	O
new	O
to	O
the	O
area	O
and	O
tried	O
Pick	O
a	O
bgel	O
on	O
2nd	O
and	O
was	O
disappointed	O
with	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
and	O
I	O
thought	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
overated	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
pricey	O
side.	O

If	O
you	O
are	O
in	O
the	O
area	O
try	O
The	O
Bagel	O
Shoppe	O
on	O
74th	O
street	O
which	O
is	O
3	O
blocks	O
away	O
on	O
2nd	O
Ave.	O

Great	O
bagels,	O

and	O
a	O
good	O
place	O
to	O
hang	O
out	O
in.	O

You	O
fellas	O
above	O
says	O
its	O
the	O
best	O
Taiwanese	O
restaurant	O
in	O
town.	O

However	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
ONLY	O
Taiwanese	O
restaurant	O
in	O
town.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
okay	O
and	O
the	O
prices	O
here	O
are	O
mediocre.	O

You	O
can't	O
say	O
its	O
cheap	O
because	O
food	O
is	O
cheaper	O
in	O
Chinatown.	O

They're	O
are	O
better	O
Taiwanese	O
restaurants	O
and	O
they	O
are	O
located	O
in	O
Flushing,	O
Queens.	O

Baluchi's	B-A
	O
has	O
solid	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
a	O
nice	O
decor	B-A
	O
at	O
reasonable	O
prices.	O

The	O
only	O
problem	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
manager	B-A
	O
is	O
a	O
complete	O
incompetent.	O

He	O
offers	O
subpar	O
service	B-A
	O
and	O
has	O
no	O
personality.	O

In	O
fact,	O
it	O
appears	O
he	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
go	O
postal	O
at	O
any	O
moment.	O

Skip	O
this	O
location	O
and	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
one	O
in	O
Soho.	O

There	O
is	O
no	O
excuse	O
for	O
such	O
lousy	O
service	B-A
!	O

I	O
have	O
never	O
before	O
eaten	O
40	O
pieces	O
of	O
relatively	O
good	O
nigiri	B-A
.	O

Stuffing	O
yourself	O
with	O
Japanese	O
food	O
is	O
a	O
rare	O
thing.	O

You	O
can	O
do	O
it	O
here.	O

$20	O
for	O
all	B-A
you	I-A
can	I-A
eat	I-A
sushi	I-A
	O
cannot	O
be	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
Areo	B-A
	O
on	O
a	O
Sunday	O
afternoon	O
with	O
four	O
of	O
my	O
girlfriends,	O
and	O
spent	O
three	O
enjoyable	O
hours	O
there.	O

The	O
restaurant	O
was	O
packed	O
at	O
first,	O
so	O
we	O
waited	O
at	O
the	O
bar	O
for	O
about	O
20	O
minutes	O
before	O
we	O
were	O
seated.	O

Most	O
of	O
the	O
servers	B-A
	O
are	O
very	O
attentive,	O
friendly	O
and	O
quite	O
attractive.	O

The	O
atmosphere	O
was	O
mostly	O
of	O
an	O
older	O
crowd,	O
but	O
there	O
were	O
a	O
few	O
groups	O
of	O
mid	O
20's/30	O
year	O
olds	O
also.	O

The	O
vibe	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
relaxed	O
and	O
cozy,	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
great	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
excellent!	O

Me	O
and	O
my	O
girls	O
will	O
definitely	O
go	O
back.	O

Food	B-A
	O
was	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
view	B-A
of	I-A
the	I-A
new	I-A
york	I-A
city	I-A
skiline	I-A
	O
was	O
terrific	O
even	O
on	O
a	O
foggy	O
rainy	O
day	O
like	O
that	O
of	O
when	O
I	O
went.	O

I	O
would	O
highly	O
recommand	O
requesting	O
a	O
table	B-A
by	I-A
the	I-A
window	I-A

Although	O
they	O
do	O
the	O
typical	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
water	O
would	O
you	O
like	O
questions	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
good	O
and	O
overall	O
very	O
relaxing	O
to	O
place	B-A
	O
to	O
eat.	O

I've	O
eaten	O
at	O
Pizza	O
Gruppo	O
a	O
few	O
times,	O
but	O
more	O
often	O
I	O
order	O

The	O

	O
is	O
great.	O

Personal	B-A
pans	I-A
