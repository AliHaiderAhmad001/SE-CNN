are	O
incredible,	O
the	O
risottos	B-A
	O
(particularly	O
the	O
sepia	B-A
)	O
are	O
fantastic	O
and	O
the	O
braised	B-A
rabbit	I-A
	O
is	O
amazing.	O

Overpriced	O
and	O
not	O
tasty	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
here	O
was	O
mediocre	O
at	O
best.	O
	O

It	O
was	O
totally	O
overpriced-	O
fish	B-A
and	I-A
chips	I-A
	O
was	O
about	O
$15....	O
	O

There	O
are	O

many	O
other	O
great	O
places	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
eat	O
and	O
drink.....	O
this	O

The	O

nothing	O

its	O

go,	O
not	O
a	O
five	O
star	O
restaraunt	B-A
.	O

Way	O
below	O
average	O

I	O
think	O
the	O
pizza	B-A
	O
is	O
so	O
overrated	O
and	O
was	O
under	O
cooked.	O

Had	O
no	O
flavor	O
and	O
the	O
staff	B-A
	O
is	O
rude	O
and	O
not	O

Would	O
NEVER	O
go	O
back	O

I	O
love	O
this	O

	O

I	O
wasn't	O
here	O
for	O
the	O

I	O
can't	O
comment	O
on	O
that	O
yet	O
but	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
was	O
very	O
good.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
quick	O
and	O
friendly.	O

Everyone	O
was	O
smiling	O
so	O
that	O
made	O
me	O
feel	O
welcome.	O

I	O
thought	O
the	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
was	O
nice	O
and	O
clean.	O

I	O
ordered	O
the	O
vitello	B-A
alla	I-A
marsala	I-A
	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
pretty	O
impressed.	O

The	O
veal	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
mushrooms	B-A
	O
were	O
cooked	O
perfectly.	O

The	O
potato	B-A
balls	I-A
	O
were	O
not	O
dry	O
at	O
all...	O
in	O
fact	O
it	O
was	O
buttery.	O

The	O
only	O
downside...	O
they	O
only	O
take	O
cash	O
which	O
is	O
OK	O
if	O
you	O
know	O
about	O
it	O

what	O

the	O

gyros	B-A

What	O
really	O
makes	O
it	O
shine	O
is	O
the	O
food	B-A
,	O
which	O
is	O
aggressively	O
seasoned	O
with	O

all	O

Good	O
Experience	O

During	O
our	O
trip	O
to	O
NYC,	O
we	O
made	O
reservations	O
to	O
dine	O
in	O
the	O
pool	O
room	O
of	O
the	O
Four	O
Seasons	O
for	O
their	O
pre-theater	O
menu	O
(offering	O
a	O
modified	O
menu	O
for	O
$65	O
pp).	O

The	O
wine	B-A
list	I-A
	O
was	O
extensive	O
-	O
though	O
the	O
staff	B-A
	O
did	O
not	O
seem	O
knowledgeable	O
about	O
wine	O
pairings.	O

The	O
bread	B-A
	O
we	O
received	O
was	O
horrible	O
-	O
rock	O
hard	O
and	O
cold	O
-	O
and	O
the	O
"free"	O
appetizer	B-A
of	I-A
olives	I-A
	O
was	O
disappointing.	O

However,	O
our	O
main	B-A
course	I-A
	O
was	O
wonderful.	O

I	O
had	O
fish	B-A
	O
and	O
my	O
husband	O
had	O
the	O
filet	B-A
	O
-	O
both	O
of	O
which	O
exceeded	O
our	O
expectations.	O

The	O
dessert	O
(we	O
had	O
a	O
pear	B-A
torte	I-A
)	O
was	O
good	O
-	O
but,	O
once	O
again,	O
the	O
staff	B-A
	O
was	O
unable	O
to	O
provide	O
appropriate	O
drink	O
suggestions.	O

When	O
we	O
inquired	O
about	O
ports	O
-	O
the	O
waitress	B-A
	O
listed	O
off	O
several	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
taste	O
variations	O
or	O
cost.	O

Not	O
what	O
I	O
would	O
expect	O
for	O
the	O
price	O
and	O
prestige	O
of	O
this	O
location	B-A
.	O

All	O
in	O
all,	O
I	O
would	O
return	O
-	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
beautiful	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
-	O
but	O
I	O
hope	O
the	O
staff	B-A
	O
pays	O
more	O
attention	O
to	O
the	O
little	O
details	O
in	O
the	O
future.	O

short	O
and	O
sweet	O
–	O
seating	B-A
	O
is	O
great:it's	O
romantic,cozy	O
and	O
private.	O

The	O
boths	B-A
	O
are	O
not	O
as	O
small	O
as	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
reviews	O
make	O
them	O
out	O
to	O
look	O
they're	O
perfect	O
for	O
2	O
people.	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
was	O
extremely	O
fast	O
and	O
attentive(thanks	O
to	O
the	O
service	B-A
button	I-A
	O
on	O
your	O
table)	O
but	O
I	O
barely	O
understood	O
1	O
word	O
when	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
	O
took	O
our	O
order.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
ok	O
and	O
fair	O
nothing	O
to	O
go	O
crazy.	O

over.	O

Over	O
all	O
the	O
looks	B-A
	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
exceeds	O
the	O
actual	O
meals	B-A
.	O

So	O
what	O
you	O
really	O
end	O
up	O
paying	O
for	O
is	O
the	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
not	O
the	O
food	B-A
.	O

Will	O
prob.	O
not	O
return	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
great	O

!	O

I've	O
been	O
wanting	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
this	O
place	O
forever	O
and	O
finally	O
got	O
a	O
table.	O

The	O
menu	B-A
	O
looked	O
great,	O
and	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
nice,	O
but	O
when	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
came,	O
it	O
was	O
average.	O

Nevertheless,	O
I	O
finished	O
my	O
plate,	O
and	O
that's	O
when	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
maggot	O
in	O
mushroom	B-A
sauce	I-A
	O
at	O
the	O
bottom.	O

I	O
showed	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
manager	B-A
,	O
and	O
he	O
smilingly	O
apologized	O
and	O
brought	O
us	O
two	O
free	O
desserts	O
(but	O
did	O
not	O
ask	O
us	O
what	O
we	O
wanted	O
and	O
so	O
brought	O
the	O
last	O
two	O
desserts	O
we	O
would	O
have	O
asked	O
for).	O

When	O
the	O
bill	O
came,	O
nothing	O
was	O
comped,	O
so	O
I	O
told	O
the	O
manager	O
very	O
politely	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
willing	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
the	O
wine,	O
but	O
I	O
didn't	O
think	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
food	O
with	O
a	O
maggot	O
in	O
it.	O

Yes,	O
I	O
ate	O
the	O
food,	O
but	O
I	O
certainly	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
the	O
maggot	O
before	O
eating,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
this	O
point	O
fairly	O
sick	O
to	O
my	O
stomach.	O

The	O
manager	B-A
	O
finally	O
said	O
he	O
would	O
comp	O
the	O
two	O
glasses	O
of	O
wine	O
(which	O
cost	O
less	O
than	O
the	O
food),	O
and	O
made	O
it	O
seem	O
like	O
a	O
big	O
concession.	O

We	O
paid	O
and	O
left	O
because	O
we	O
didn't	O
feel	O
like	O
arguing	O
any	O
more.	O

I	O
have	O

I've	O
had	O
my	O
fair	O
share	O
of	O
modern	B-A
Japanese	I-A
	O
and	O
this	O
spot	O
delivers.	O

The	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
was	O
pretty	O
nice	O
but	O
had	O
a	O
bit	O
lacking,	O
which	O
it	O
tries	O
to	O
make	O
up	O
for	O
with	O
a	O
crazy	O
scheme	B-A
of	I-A
mirrors	I-A
.	O

If	O
you're	O
into	O
being	O
lost	O
when	O
you're	O
just	O
five	O
feet	O
from	O
your	O
table	O
then	O
hey,	O
that's	O
a	O
good	O
thing.	O

Despite	O
the	O
confusing	O
mirrors	B-A
	O
this	O
will	O
likely	O
be	O
my	O
go-to	O
for	O

	O
for	O
the	O
foreseeable	O

The	O

of	O
the	O
dishes	B-A
	O
(I	O
have	O
to	O
agree	O
with	O
a	O

are	O
quite	O

My	O

even	O
she	O
(being	O
Indian)	O
feels	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
can	O
be	O
somewhat	O
over	O
the	O
top	O
spicy	O
and	O
far	O
too	O
oily.	O

Still	O
we	O
keep	O
going	O
back	O
:)	O

I	O
was	O
speechless	O
by	O
the	O
horrible	O
food	B-A

I	O
attended	O
a	O
holiday	O
dinner	O
at	O
the	O
restaurant,	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
majorly	O
disappointing.	O

Rather	O
than	O
eating	O
the	O
meat	O

being	O
offered,	O
I	O
requested	O
a	O
vegetarian	O
dish.	O

Rather	O
than	O

the	O

(minus	O

or	O
any	O

I	O
was	O
so	O
stunned,	O
and	O
I	O
left	O
the	O
dinner	O
hungry	O
and	O
majorly	O
disappointing.	O

This	O

	O
survives	O
on	O

alone.	O

I	O

The	O
flavors	O
are	O

and	O
the	O

Be	O
prepared	O
to	O
wait,	O
because	O
the	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
pretty	O
tiny.	O

Also,	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
take	O
credit	O
card	O
so	O
come	O
with	O
cash!	O

Even	O
though	O
the	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
not	O
beautiful,	O
the	O

for	O
itself.	O

AMAZING	O
MY	O
FAVORITE!!!	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
living	O
in	O
NYC	O
for	O
bit	O
now	O
and	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
I	O
love	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
and	O
explore	O
the	O
scene.	O

I	O
came	O
across	O
Village	B-A
Underground	I-A
	O
by	O
accident,	O
now	O
I	O
go	O
there	O
all	O
the	O
time.	O

The	O
martinis	B-A
	O
are	O
amazing	O
and	O
very	O
fairly	O
priced.	O

THE	O
SERVICE	B-A
	O
IS	O
AMAZING,	O
i've	O
had	O
different	O
waiters	B-A
	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
nice,	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
rare	O
thing	O
in	O
NYC.	O

The	O
DJ	B-A
	O
is	O
awesome,	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
there	O
for	O
my	O
birthday	O
and	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
other	O
times	O
with	O
friends	O
and	O
I	O
keep	O
going	O
back.	O

You	O
can	O
get	O
a	O
table	O
without	O
a	O
reservation	O
if	O
you	O
get	O
there	O
early	O
I	O
they	O
don't	O
make	O
you	O
by	O
bottles.	O

Which	O
lets	O
face	O
it....at	O
times	O
it's	O
a	O
good	O
thing.	O

In	O
the	O
end	O
you	O
end	O
up	O
with	O
a	O
fair	O
tab	O
and	O
NOTHING	O
BUT	O
A	O
GREAT	O
TIME!!!	O

Highly	O
recommended!	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
best,	O
if	O
not	O
THE	O
best,	O
restaurants	O
in	O
Park	O
Slope	O
(and	O
NY	O
in	O
general)	O

Everything	O
on	O
the	O
menu	B-A
	O
is	O
great.	O
	O

This	O
establishment	B-A
	O
is	O
the	O
real	O
deal.	O
	O

Wish	O
NY	O
had	O
more	O
of	O
these	O
kind	O
of	O
places:	O
intimate,	O
superb	O
food	B-A
,	O
homey,	O
top	O
notch	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
around,	O
certainly	O
worth	O
the	O
wait.	O

There	O
is	O
"Expensive-but-worth-it"	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
"Expensive-and-WTF"?	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
twenty-something	O
guy	O
that	O
doesn't	O
mind	O
laying	O
down	O
$300	O
for	O
a	O
fine	O
and	O
delicious	O
meal	O
for	O
2	O
on	O
special	O
occassions.	O

But	O
$500	O
for	O
a	O
dinner	B-A
for	I-A
two	I-A
	O
that	O
didn't	O
include	O
Wine?	O

Are	O
you	O
freaking	O
kidding	O
me?	O

Look,	O
the	O
appetizers	B-A
	O
were	O
really	O
good.	O

The	O
entree	B-A
	O
was	O
also	O
very	O
good.	O

Can't	O
argue	O
about	O
that,	O
but	O
they	O
are	O
clearly	O
over	O
priced.	O

What	O
you	O
are	O
paying	O
for	O
is	O
the	O
environment	B-A
	O
and	O
the	O
name.	O

Yes,	O
the	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
classy	O
and	O
beautiful,	O
but	O
they	O
most	O
certainly	O
target	O
the	O
uber	O
whealthy	O
Not	O
the	O
common	O
joe	O
that	O
wants	O
to	O
go	O
all	O
out	O
every	O
once	O
in	O
a	O
while.	O

$500	O

glasses	O
of	O
Dom	O
Perignon	O
at	O
$35	O
each.	O

Starters:	O

Sashimi.	O

Which	O
of	O
course	O
is	O
not	O
real	O
Kobe	O
but	O
Wagyu	O
beef.	O

Surprised	O
that	O
a	O
place	O
of	O
this	O
caliber	O
would	O
advertise	O
it	O
as	O
Kobe.	O

A	O
beef	O
Consomme.	O

Entrees:	O
Vanison	O
steak	O
and	O
Bison	O
Steak.	O

Vanison	B-A
	O
was	O
good	O
but	O
not	O
amazing.	O

Bison	B-A
	O
was	O
quite	O
excellent	O
however.	O

Dessert	B-A
:	O
pure	O
disaster.	O

Just	O
not	O
good	O
at	O
all.	O

Some	O
Pineapple	O
covered	O
in	O
a	O
glaze	O
of	O
some	O
kind	O
and	O
some	O
pear	O
tart	O
thing	O
Not	O
impressive	O
at	O
all.	O

I	O
read	O
reviews	O
that	O
called	O
the	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
too	O
expensive	O
and	O
I	O
thought	O
to	O
myself,	O
but	O
may	O
be	O
it	O
is	O
worth	O
it.	O

I	O
was	O
wrong.	O

The	B-A
Four	I-A
Seasons	I-A
	O
has	O
history	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
landmark	O
of	O
New	O
York	O
City	O
restaurants,	O
but	O
trust	O
me,	O
they	O
will	O
charge	O
you	O
through	O
the	O
nose	O
just	O
so	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
say	O
"I've	O
been	O
to	O
the	O
four	O
seasons	O
restaurant".	O

I	O
wanted	O
to	O
go	O
there	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
worth	O
it	O
and	O
sadly,	O
curiousity	O
got	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
me	O
and	O
I	O
paid	O
dearly	O
for	O
it.	O

All	O
in	O
all,	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
great	O
(except	O
for	O
the	O
dessserts	B-A
).	O

The	O
environment	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
upscale	O
and	O
you	O
will	O
see	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
rich	O
guys	O
with	O
trophy	O
wives	O
or	O
just	O
highly	O
paid	O
escorts.	O

If	O
you	O
are	O
going	O
for	O
the	O
food	B-A
,	O
it	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
worth	O
it.	O

Yes,	O
it	O
is	O
good,	O
but	O
I've	O
had	O
better	O
for	O
cheaper.	O

You	O
would	O
think	O
they	O
would	O
make	O
up	O
for	O
it	O
with	O
service	B-A
,	O
sadly,	O
no.	O

Service	B-A
	O
was	O
just	O
ok,	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
what	O
you'd	O
expect	O
for	O
$500.	O

Terrible	O
Waste	O
of	O
money..	O
scammers	O

I	O
agree	O
that	O
dining	O
at	O
Casa	B-A
La	I-A
Femme	I-A
	O
is	O
like	O
no	O
other	O
dining	O
experience!	O

BUT	O
not	O
in	O
a	O
good	O
way.	O

I	O
am	O
actually	O
offended	O
to	O
have	O
spent	O
so	O
much	O
money	O
on	O
such	O
a	O
bad	O
experience.	O

I	O
literally	O
just	O
got	O
back	O
home	O
after	O
visiting	O
Casa	B-A
La	I-A
Femme	I-A
	O
and	O
was	O
so	O
offended	O
by	O
my	O
visit	O
felt	O
it	O
necessary	O
to	O
try	O
and	O
warn	O
other	O
diners	O
who	O
value	O
their	O
money	O
and	O
time.	O

We	O
went	O
to	O
celebrate	O
two	O
birthdays	O
and	O
wanted	O
to	O
do	O
something	O
special	O
and	O
different.	O

Our	O
visit	O
their	O
to	O
say	O
the	O
least,	O
was	O
an	O
unpleasant	O
and	O
costly	O
experience!	O

And	O
even	O
more	O
so	O
unpleasant	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
costly	O
for	O
such	O
an	O
unpleasant	O
experience.	O

We	O
did	O
arrive	O
late	O
for	O
our	O
reservation	O
so	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
complain	O
too	O
much	O
about	O
the	O
wait	B-A
	O
for	O
a	O
table.	O

Although	O
we	O
were	O
told	O
10-15	O
minutes	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
more	O
like	O
45	O
minutes.	O

We	O
were	O
ushered	O
to	O
the	O
bar	O
to	O
wait	O
momentarily	O
and	O
upon	O
arrival	O
were	O
so	O
excited.	O

The	O
place	B-A
	O
is	O
beautiful!	O

The	O
hostess	B-A
	O
was	O
very	O
pleasant.	O

However,	O
our	O
$14	O
drinks	B-A
	O
were	O
were	O
horrible!	O

Once	O
we	O
finally	O
got	O
a	O
table,	O
despite	O
indicating	O
we	O
wanted	O
an	O
alla	O
carte	O
menu	O
we	O
were	O
pushed	O
into	O
a	O
table	O
that	O
was	O
only	O
price	O
fixed!	O

Since	O
we	O
were	O
already	O
waiting	O
so	O
long,	O
we	O
felt	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
other	O
choice	O
but	O
to	O
accept	O
it.	O

Our	O
experience	O
did	O
not	O
ever	O
get	O
any	O
better.	O

For	O
each	O
course	O
we	O
waited	O
over	O
1/2	O
hour	O
to	O
45	O
minutes	O
and	O
were	O
never	O
offered	O
a	O
drink.	O

We	O
also	O
asked	O
for	O
Hooka	O
six	O
times	O
and	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
	O
kept	O
telling	O
us	O
one	O
minute	O
and	O
never	O
returning	O
with	O
the	O
Hooka.	O

After	O
the	O
4th	O
time	O
i	O
asked	O
again	O
and	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
	O
than	O
said	O
after	O
our	O
dinner.	O

We	O
asked	O
for	O
beverages	O
and	O
never	O
received	O
them.	O

We	O
asked	O
for	O
sides	O
which	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
	O
than	O
admitted	O
that	O
he	O
forgot	O
to	O
put	O
in	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
our	O
order.	O

My	O
chicken	B-A
	O
was	O
inedible	O
as	O
there	O
were	O
so	O
many	O
fatty	O
lumps	O
which	O
i	O
had	O
to	O
keep	O
spitting	O
out	O
into	O
my	O
napkin.	O

I	O
would	O
not	O
expect	O
this	O
for	O
a	O
$55	O
dinner	B-A
.	O

By	O
the	O
time	O
we	O
finished	O
our	O
dinner	O
we	O
still	O
had	O
not	O
received	O
one	O
beverage	O
NOR	O
hooka!	O

What	O
we	O
did	O
do	O
was	O
waste	O
3	O
hours	O
being	O
trapped	O
in	O
a	O
table	O
waiting	O
and	O
waiting	O
for	O
food	O
and	O
drinks	O
and	O
hooka..	O
some	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
never	O
received!	O

The	O
only	O
beverage	O
we	O
did	O
receive	O
was	O
water	O
in	O
dirty	O
glasses!	O

To	O
top	O
it	O
all	O
off..	O
the	O
main	O
reason	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
your	O
restaurant	O
was	O
for	O
the	O
belly	O
dancers	O
and	O
missed	O
the	O
first	O
show	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
seated	O
yet	O
and	O
the	O
2nd	O
belly	O
dancer	O
only	O
danced	O
at	O
two	O
tables	O
in	O
the	O
back	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	O
and	O
never	O
made	O
it	O
around	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
half	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant.	O

By	O
the	O
time	O
we	O
left	O
our	O
wallets	O
were	O
empy	O
and	O
so	O
were	O
our	O
stomachs	O
AND	O
we	O
missed	O
the	O
show	O
we	O
were	O
supposed	O
to	O
see	O
following	O
our	O
dinner,	O
which	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
acceptable	O
if	O
we	O
got	O
to	O
enjoy	O
the	O
experience	O
of	O
good	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
belly	O
dancers!	O

If	O
it	O
seemed	O
possible	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
while	O
there	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
fought	O
my	O
bill	O
since	O
my	O
dinner	O
portion	O
of	O
my	O
meal	B-A
	O
was	O
inedible!	O

I	O
have	O
never	O
left	O
a	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
feeling	O
as	O
if	O
i	O
was	O
abused,	O
and	O
wasted	O
my	O
hard	O
earned	O
money.	O

MY	O
husbands	O
birthday	O
and	O
my	O
sons	O
was	O
not	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
intended...	O
and	O
we	O
drove	O
two	O
hours	O
to	O
spend	O
too	O
much	O
money	O
to	O
be	O
treated	O
terribly!	O

I	O
wish	O
I	O
COULD	O
be	O
refunded!	O

Don't	O
go	O
with	O
a	O
larger	O
group	O
than	O
4!	O

I	O
went	O
here	O
for	O
a	O
family	O
birthday	O
dinner.	O

Five	O
of	O
us	O
walked	O
in	O
at	O
approximately	O
6:20	O
on	O
a	O
Thursday	O
evening.	O

The	O
hostess	O
said	O
"Wow	O
that's	O
a	O
large	O
group,	O
unless	O
you	O
aren't	O
together",	O
to	O
which	O
I	O
replied	O
"no	O
we	O
are,	O
and	O
there	O
will	O
be	O
one	O
more,	O
so	O
a	O
table	O
for	O
six	O
please."	O

At	O
first	O
we	O
were	O
a	O
little	O
taken	O
aback,	O
as	O
this	O
seemed	O
to	O
present	O
a	O
problem,	O
although	O
the	O
restaurant	O
looked	O
fairly	O
empty,	O
but	O
they	O
hastily	O
put	O
the	O
table	O
together	O
for	O
us.	O

The	O
menu	B-A
	O
is	O
fairly	O
simple	O
without	O
much	O
descriptions.	O
	O

There	O
was	O
no	O
tap	O
beer	B-A
	O
that	O
evening,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
disappointment.	O
	O

Not	O
much	O
of	O
a	O
selection	B-A
of	I-A
bottled	I-A
beer	I-A
	O
either,	O
we	O
went	O
with	O
Brahma.	O
	O

The	O
appetizers	O
we	O
ordered	O
were	O
served	O
quickly	O
-	O
an	O
order	O
of	O
fried	B-A
oysters	I-A
and	I-A
clams	I-A
	O
were	O
delicious	O
but	O
a	O
tiny	O
portion	O
(maybe	O
3	O
of	O
each).	O
	O

The	O
lobster	B-A
knuckles	I-A
	O
(special	O
of	O
the	O
day)	O
were	O
ok,	O
but	O
pretty	O
tasteless.	O

I	O
believe	O
there	O
were	O
2	O
shrimp	O
in	O
the	O
"salt	B-A
encrusted	I-A
shrimp"	I-A
appetizer	I-A
.	O
	O

After	O
we	O
ate	O
our	O
appetizers	O
(which	O
took	O
all	O
of	O
8	O
minutes)	O
we	O
ordered	O
another	O
round	O
of	O
Brahma's	O
-	O
and	O
tried	O
to	O
stall	O
a	O
little	O
as	O
we	O
waited	O
for	O
our	O
sixth	O
dinner	O
member.	O

The	O
waitress	O
appeared	O
and	O
asked	O
us	O
if	O
we	O
wanted	O
to	O
go	O
ahead	O
and	O
order.	O

We	O
replied	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
wait	O
5	O
more	O
minutes	O
if	O
that	O
was	O
okay.	O

She	O
replied	O
"well	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
convenient	O
for	O
us	O
if	O
you	O
ordered	O
now,	O
since	O
you	O
are	O
a	O
larger	O
party,	O
and	O
it	O
might	O
get	O
crowded."	O

We	O
called	O
the	O
other	O
person	O
who	O
was	O
very	O
close	O
by,	O
and	O
she	O
told	O
us	O
to	O
order	O
for	O
her,	O
so	O
we	O
did.	O

The	O
food	O
arrived	O
in	O
about	O
15	O
minutes.	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
Thai	B-A
style	I-A
Fried	I-A
Sea	I-A
Bass	I-A
...which	O
was	O
very	O
good.	O
	O

Everyone	O
seemed	O
generally	O
happy	O
with	O
their	O
food	B-A
,	O
except	O
my	O
brother	O
who	O
had	O
the	O
grilled	B-A
Mahi	I-A
Mahi	I-A
,	O
seemingly	O
drenched	O
in	O
Grapfruit	O
Juice!	O
	O

I	O
heard	O
the	O
lobster	B-A
roll	I-A
	O
was	O
excellent.	O
	O

They	O
seemed	O
to	O
continue	O
to	O
rush	O
us	O
along,	O
taking	O
plates	O
without	O
asking	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
done	O
(my	O
sister	O
still	O
had	O
her	O
fork	O
in	O
hand).	O

All	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
good	O
-	O
a	O
little	O
on	O
the	O
expensive	O
side,	O
but	O
fresh.	O
	O

Service	B-A
	O
not	O
the	O
friendliest	O
to	O
our	O
"large	O
party"!	O
	O

Probably	O
would	O
not	O
go	O
back	O
here.	O

Great	O
Indian	B-A
food	I-A
	O

I	O
lived	O
on	O
50th	O
st,	O
and	O
wanted	O
Indian	O
one	O
day	O
so	O
decided	O
to	O
check	O
this	O
place	O
out.	O

Food	B-A
	O
was	O
amazing	O
-	O
I	O
love	O
Indian	O
food	O
and	O
eat	O
it	O
quite	O
regularly,	O
but	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
this	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
I've	O
had.	O

Very	O
"normal	O
Indian	B-A
food	I-A
",	O
but	O
done	O
really	O
well.	O

I	O
have	O
it	O
a	O
4	O
instead	O
of	O
5	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
price	O
(just	O
chicken	B-A
tikka	I-A
masala	I-A
	O
-	O
no	O
bread	O
of	O
rice	O
-	O
is	O
$25),	O
which	O
I	O
would	O
expect	O
at	O
a	O
upscale	O
Indian	O
restaurant	O
but	O
this	O
place	B-A
	O
doesn't	O
have	O
an	O
upscale	O
feel	B-A
.	O

Also,	O
waiters	B-A
	O
try	O
to	O
push	O
more	O
food	O
on	O
you,	O
like	O
suggest	O
things	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
are	O
complimentary	O
when	O
they	O
actually	O
cost	O
$.	O

I	O
don't	O
appreciate	O
places	O
or	O
people	O
that	O
try	O
to	O
drive	O
up	O
the	O
bill	O
without	O
the	O
patron's	O
knowledge	O
so	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
huge	O
turnoff	O
(more	O
than	O
the	O
price).	O

But	O
if	O
you're	O
prepared	O
to	O
spend	O
some	O
$	O
and	O
remember	O
to	O
ask	O
if	O
something	O
they	O
offer	O
is	O
complimentary,	O
then	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
place	B-A
	O
to	O
go	O
for	O
Indian	B-A

This	O
will	O
be	O
only	O
the	O
third	O
online	O
review	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
made	O
about	O
a	O
restaurant	O
in	O
my	O
life.	O

They	O
have	O
all	O
been	O
tonight	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
all	O
been	O
about	O
the	O
same	O
restaurant.	O

I	O
have	O
never	O
been	O
so	O
disgusted	O
by	O
both	O
food	B-A
	O
an	O
service	B-A
.	O

For	O
starters	O
they	O
delivered	O
us	O
someone	O
else's	O
order.	O

Fine,	O
I	O
wont	O
hang	O
you	O
for	O
that.	O

However,	O
once	O
I	O
received	O
my	O
predictably	O
mediocre	O
order	O
of	O
what	O
Dokebi	O
thinks	O
passes	O
as	O
Korean	B-A
fair	I-A
,	O
(sometimes	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
settle	O
when	O
it's	O
your	O
only	O
option),	O
I	O
got	O
through	O
about	O
half	O
my	O
kimchee	B-A
	O
before	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
random	O
lettuce	O
accompanied	O
by	O
a	O
far	O
more	O
disgusting,	O
slimy,	O
clearly	O
bad	O
piece	O
of	O
fish	O
skin.	O

Not	O
one	O
to	O
jump	O
to	O
complaints	O
(hence	O
my	O
lack	O
of	O
previous	O
online	O
reviewing),	O
I	O
called	O
the	O
restaurant	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
a	O
heads	O
up	O
that	O
their	O
kitchen	O
might	O
want	O
to	O
check	O
the	O
cleanliness	O
of	O
their	O
prep	O
stations.	O

My	O
main	O
concern	O
was	O
the	O
sanity	O
of	O
the	O
food	B-A
	O
that	O
was	O
being	O
sent	O
out	O
to	O
myself	O
and	O
others,	O
but	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
lying	O
is	O
I	O
said	O
that	O
as	O
someone	O
who	O
has	O
worked	O
in	O
restaurants	O
since	O
the	O
age	O
of	O
fifteen	O
I	O
was	O
expecting	O
at	O
least	O
a	O
minimal	O
effort	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	O
to	O
amend	O
the	O
situation.	O

None	O
was	O
made	O
so	O
i	O
hung	O
up.	O

Less	O
than	O
three	O
minutes	O
passed	O
before	O
I	O
found	O
myself	O
doubled	O
over	O
the	O
toilet.	O

My	O
girlfriend,	O
being	O
slightly	O
more	O
aggressive,	O
and	O
having	O
been	O
equally	O
disgusted	O
causing	O
her	O
to	O
throw	O
out	O
the	O
remainder	O
of	O
her	O
barely	O
eaten	O
meal	B-A
,	O
called	O
back	O
only	O
to	O
be	O
informed	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
probably	O
wrong	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
most	O
likely	O
an	O
oyster,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
also	O
blacklisted	O
from	O
their	O
restaurant.	O

Not	O
only	O
have	O
I	O
worked	O
in	O
restaurants	O
for	O
many	O
years,	O
I	O
am	O
now	O
in	O
culinary	O
school,	O
I	O
am	O
a	O
huge	O
lover	O
of	O
oysters	O
and	O
fish,	O
and	O
my	O
girlfriend	O
is	O
half	O
Korean!	O

We	O
know	O
the	O
difference	O
between	O
and	O
oyster	O
and	O
bad	O
fish.	O

It	O
wasn't	O
as	O
if	O
this	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
had	O
any	O
major	O
bragging	O
points	O
before	O
hand,	O
but	O
now	O
it's	O
simply	O
repulsive.	O

	O
which	O
we	O
enjoyed	O

The	O

the	O

	O
knew	O
everything	O
about	O

My	O
wife	O
and	O
I	O
visited	O
Dokebi	O
tonight.	O

We	O
ordered	O
dosut	O
bibimbap	O
and	O
nakgi-bokum.	O

The	O
dishes	O
came	O
out	O
around	O
5	O
minutes	O
apart.	O

The	O
bibimbap	B-A
	O
was	O
average,	O
but	O
the	O
stone	B-A
bowl	I-A
	O
wasn't	O
even	O
close	O
to	O
sizzling.	O

Too	O
bad	O
I	O
had	O
paid	O
an	O
extra	O
$2	O
for	O
the	O
stone	B-A
bowl	I-A
.	O

The	O
nakgi-bokum	B-A
	O
was	O
horrible.	O

Easily	O
the	O
worst	O
stir-fried	B-A
squid	I-A
	O
I've	O
ever	O
tasted.	O

The	O
sauce	B-A
	O
tasted	O
more	O
like	O
Chinese	O
fast	O
food	O
than	O
decent	O
Korean.	O

The	O
side	B-A
dishes	I-A
	O
were	O
passable,	O
and	O
I	O
did	O
get	O
a	O
refill	O
upon	O
request.	O

The	O
real	O
problem	O
I	O
had	O
with	O
this	O
place	O
was	O
the	O
complete	O
lack	O
of	O
service	B-A
.	O

I	O
mentioned	O
the	O
squid	O
dish	O
wasn't	O
very	O
good	O
when	O
the	O
waitress	O
visited.	O

She	O
just	O
nodded	O
and	O
walked	O
off.	O

There	O
were	O
no	O
communications	O
issues	O
either,	O
as	O
she	O
spoke	O
perfect	O
English.	O

As	O
to	O
my	O
comment	O
about	O
the	O
food,	O
no	O
apology	O
or	O
acknowledgment	O
was	O
made.	O

My	O
wife	O
had	O
barely	O
touched	O
that	O
mess	O
of	O
a	O
dish	B-A
.	O

We	O
were	O
charged	O

If	O
you	O

I	O
suggest	O

some	O
of	O
the	O

We've	O
lived	O
around	O
the	O
corner	O
from	O
this	O
place	O
for	O
over	O
a	O
year	O
and	O
finally	O
had	O
dinner	O
there.	O

We've	O
tried	O
before	O
but	O
it	O
always	O
packed	O
and	O
doesn't	O
take	O
reservations.	O

It	O
was	O
well	O
worth	O
the	O
wait.	O

The	O
wife	O
had	O
the	O
risotto	B-A
	O
which	O
was	O
amazing.	O

It	O
doesn't	O
look	O
appetizing	O
as	O
it's	O
covered	O
in	O
squid	O
ink	O
and	O
it	O
turns	O
your	O
lips	O
and	O
teeth	O
black,	O
but	O
the	O
taste	O
was	O
phenomenal.	O

The	O
farro	B-A
salad	I-A
	O
and	O
the	O
mashed	B-A
yukon	I-A

	O
were	O

extremely	O

every	O

are	O

A	O
quintessential	O
slice	B-A
of	I-A
NYC	I-A
pizza	I-A
.	O

The	O
crust	B-A
	O
has	O
a	O
great	O
bite	O
and	O
a	O
good	O
chew,	O
the	O
sauce	B-A
	O
is	O
light	O
with	O
a	O
nice	O
acidity	O
to	O
it,	O
the	O
salt	O
from	O
the	O
cheese	B-A
	O
is	O
great,	O
really	O
heightens	O
the	O
flavor	O
of	O
all	O
the	O

components.	O

Personally	O
I	O
like	O
the	O

	O
better,	O

they	O
are	O
all	O
good.	O

Possibly	O
the	O
Most	O
Romantic	O
Restaurant	B-A
	O

This	O
is	O
undoubtedly	O
my	O
favorite	O
modern	B-A
Japanese	I-A
brasserie	I-A
	O
(that	O
don’t	O
serve	O
sushi),	O
and	O
in	O
my	O
opinion,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
romantic	O
restaurants	O
in	O
the	O
city!	O

Not	O
only	O
is	O
it	O
an	O
adventure	O
getting	O
to	O
this	O
somewhat	O
hidden	O
spot	B-A
,	O
once	O
you	O
enter	O
the	O
unmarked	B-A
wooden	I-A
doors	I-A
,	O
the	O
zen	O
and	O
intimate	O

	O
will	O
make	O
you	O
feel	O
like	O
you’re	O
no	O
longer	O
in	O

If	O
you’re	O
planning	O
to	O
come	O
here,	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O
your	O
date	O
is	O
someone	O
whom	O
you	O
really	O
like	O
since	O
you’ll	O
be	O
ushered	O
to	O
private	B-A

,	O
which	O
was	O
such	O
a	O
wonderful	O
deal	O
since	O
it	O
also	O
came	O
with	O
a	O
flight	O
of	O
sake!	O

I	O
never	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
fan	O
of	O
sakes	O
but	O
am	O
lately	O
experimenting	O
with	O
it	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
and	O
am	O
acquiring	O
a	O
better	O
taste	O
of	O
it.	O

We	O
started	O
off	O
with	O
a	O
delightful	O
sashimi	B-A
amuse	I-A
bouche	I-A
.	O

Our	O
first	O
course	O
was	O
Tuna	O
Sashimi	O
with	O
Green	O
Yuzu	O
Sauce.	O

I	O
picked	O
the	O
Grilled	B-A
Black	I-A
Cod	I-A
	O
as	O
my	O
entree,	O
which	O
I	O
absolutely	O
devoured	O
while	O
someone	O
commented	O
that	O
the	O
Grilled	B-A
Salmon	I-A
dish	I-A
	O
was	O
better.	O

The	O
entrees	B-A
	O
were	O
served	O
with	O
miso	O
soup	O
and	O
rice.	O

The	O
sake’s	B-A
	O
complimented	O
the	O
courses	O
very	O
well	O
and	O
is	O
successfully	O
easing	O
me	O
into	O
the	O
sake	O
world.	O

For	O
desserts,	O
we	O
tried	O
the	O
frozen	B-A
black	I-A
sesame	I-A
mousse	I-A
	O
(interesting	O
but	O
not	O
extraordinary)	O
and	O
matcha	B-A
(powdered	I-A
green	I-A
tea)	I-A
and	I-A
blueberry	I-A
cheesecake	I-A
,	O
which	O
was	O
phenomenal.	O

Maybe	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
great	O
company	O
(I	O
had	O
friends	O
visiting	O
from	O
Philly	O
–	O
yes,	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
date	O
this	O
time)	O
or	O
the	O
super	O
reasonable	O
price	O
point,	O
but	O
I	O
just	O
can’t	O
say	O
enough	O
good	O
things	O
about	O
this	O
brasserie	B-A
.	O

I	O
don’t	O
usually	O
visit	O
the	O
same	O
establishment	O
more	O
than	O
once,	O
what	O
more	O
twice,	O
but	O
I’ll	O
come	O
to	O
Zenkichi	B-A
	O
anytime	O
for	O
a	O
quiet,	O
unhurried	O
and	O
memorable	O
dinner.	O

Terrible	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
compliment!	O

The	O
service	B-A
	O
leaves	O
much	O
to	O
be	O
desired,	O
from	O
feeling	O
like	O
you	O
are	O
rushed	O
the	O
place	O
your	O
order,	O
to	O
being	O
ignored	O
the	O

We	O
were	O
10	O

a	O

we	O
sat	O
in	O

We	O
paid	O
a	O
fixed	O
pricce	O
but	O
got	O
nothing!!	O

We	O
never	O
ate	O
because	O
by	O
close	O

in	O
the	O
monring	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
served	O
and	O
were	O
too	O
upset	O
ad	O
tired	O
to	O
start	O
eating.	O

They	O
are	O
extremely	O
rude,	O
not	O
even	O
apologizing	O
for	O
the	O
horrible	O
service	B-A
	O
we	O

I	O

a	O

the	O

Shabu	I-A
,	O
you	O
won't	O

only	O
one	O
I've	O
tried	O
that	O
even	O
compares	O
(shabu	O

and	O
even	O
then	O
I	O
prefer	O
Dokebi.	O

The	O

the	O

	O
are	O
great,	O
you	O

and	O
a	O

	O
free	O
with	O
your	O

the	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
good,	O
so	O
I	O
would	O
come	O
back	O
again.	O

This	O

Just	O
want	O
to	O
warn	O
you	O

and	O
the	O

I	O
went	O
here	O
with	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
for	O
our	O
anniversary.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
was	O
great	O
and	O
tasty,	O
but	O
the	O
sitting	B-A
space	I-A
	O
was	O
too	O
small,	O
I	O
don't	O
like	O
being	O
cramp	O
in	O
a	O
corner.	O

Over	O
all	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
nice	O
romantic	O
place	B-A
	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
recommend	O
to	O
ask	O
for	O
a	O
bigger	O
sitting	O
area	O
when	O
you	O
make	O
a	O
reservation	O
(if	O
possible)	O

Loved	O
it	O

A	O

and	O
I	O
tried	O
Pacifico	B-A
	O
after	O
work	O
a	O
few	O
Fridays	O
and	O
loved	O
it.	O

The	O
atmosphere	B-A
	O
was	O
great.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
we	O
ordered	O
was	O
excellent,	O
although	O
I	O
wouldn't	O
say	O
the	O
margaritas	B-A
	O
were	O
anything	O
to	O
write	O
home	O
about.	O

Our	O
waitress	B-A
	O
wasn't	O
mean,	O
but	O
not	O
especially	O
warm	O
or	O
attentive	O
either.	O

I	O
must	O
say	O
I	O
am	O
surprised	O
by	O
the	O
bad	O
reviews	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
earlier	O
in	O
the	O
year,	O
though.	O

Maybe	O
it	O
has	O
improved	O
since	O
then?	O

Regardless,	O
we'll	O
be	O
back	O
and	O
can't	O
wait	O
to	O
visit	O
in	O
the	O
summer	O
to	O
take	O
advantage	O
of	O
the	O
patio	B-A

Dumbfoundingly	O
Poor	O

This	O
was,	O
from	O
start	O

a	O
mind-bogglingly	O

experience.	O

Lexicographers	O
take	O
note:	O
a	O

The	O
servers	B-A
	O
at	O
Flatbush	O

appear	O
to	O
have	O
perfected	O
that	O
ghastly	O
technique	O
of	O
making	O
you	O
feel	O
guilty	O
and	O
ashamed	O
for	O
deigning	O
to	O
attract	O
their	O
attention.	O

Polite	O
acknowledgement	O
is	O
out;	O

supercilious	O
scorn	O
is	O
in.	O

And	O
how	O
many	O
times	O
can	O
you	O
pick	O
up	O
the	O
same	O
perfectly	O
aligned	O
set	O
of	O

inspect	O
them	O
vapidly	O

we	O

our	O

We	O
arrived	O
and	O
were	O
seated	O
immediately,	O
which	O
made	O
us	O
both	O
happy.	O

We	O
ordered	O
our	O
appetizers,	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
chicken	O
and	O
my	O

the	O

Everything	O
was	O
going	O
good	O
until	O

I	O
took	O
one	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
chicken	B-A
	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
appalled.	O

It	O
was	O

over	O
a	O
bed	O
of	O
extremely	O
undercooked	O

My	O

asked	O
me	O
if	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
switch	O
and	O
eat	O
his	O
salmon	O
instead,	O
while	O
he	O
de-skinned	O
the	O
chicken	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
could	O

the	O
one	O
in	O
Flatbush	O
Farms.	O

At	O
this	O
point,	O
the	O
waitress	B-A
	O
comes	O
over	O
and	O
asks	O
us	O
if	O
everything	O
was	O
okay,	O
I	O
was	O
literally	O
so	O
shocked	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
speechless	O
and	O
didn't	O
say	O
anything,	O
and	O
guess	O
what,	O
the	O
waitress	O
WALKED	O
away.	O

So,	O
I	O
switch	O
with	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
again	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
maybe	O
I	O
could	O
stomach	O
the	O
meat	O
and	O
spinach	O
again,	O
but	O
the	O
spinach	B-A
	O
was	O
so	O
undercooked	O
that	O
I	O
just	O
could	O
not	O
bite	O
through	O
it.	O

I	O
couldn't	O
even	O
enjoy	O
the	O
mashed	O
potatoes	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
hidden	O
completely	O
under	O
the	O
chicken	O
and	O
spinach.	O

I've	O
had	O
better	O
chicken	O
at	O
BBQs!!!!	O

So	O
I	O
decide	O
to	O
report	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
waitress	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
completely	O
inedible.	O

Guess	O
what,	O
I	O
waited	O
for	O
TWENTY	O
minutes	O
before	O
she	O
came	O
over	O
and	O
when	O
she	O
finally	O
did,	O
she	O
says,	O
"oh	O
well,	O
I	O
wish	O
you	O
would	O
have	O
said	O
something	O
earlier"	O
No	O
apology,	O
nothing.	O

After	O
that	O
she	O
simply	O
took	O
our	O
plates,	O
walked	O
away,	O
came	O
back	O
another	O
TWENTY	O
minutes	O
later	O
with	O
the	O
bill	O
and	O
the	O
chicken	O
on	O
it!!!!!!!!!!!!	O

No	O
desert	O
menu,	O
no	O
apology,	O
nothing!!!!!!	O

I	O
was	O
literally	O
going	O
to	O
explode,	O
but	O
instead,	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
took	O
the	O
bill	O
and	O
went	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
manager.	O

This	O
is	O
where	O
it	O
really	O
really	O
gets	O
bad:	O
the	O
manager	B-A
	O
said,	O
there	O
is	O
absolutely	O
nothing	O
we	O
can	O
do,	O
it's	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
taste	O
that	O
she	O
didn't	O
like	O
it,	O
and	O
I	O
cannot	O
comp	O
it.	O

Again,	O
no	O
apology,	O
no	O
is	O
there	O
anything	O
else	O
I	O
can	O
get	O
you,	O
no	O
can	O
I	O
get	O
you	O
a	O
drink	O
to	O
make	O
up	O
for	O
it,	O
nothing!!!!	O

We	O
refused	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
it	O
because	O
at	O
this	O
point	O
it	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
the	O
food	O
anymore.	O

The	O
level	O
of	O
rudeness	O
was	O
preposterous.	O

The	O
manager	B-A
	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
table	O
and	O
said	O
we	O
can	O
do	O
what	O
we	O
want,	O
so	O
we	O
paid	O
for	O
what	O
we	O
did	O
enjoy,	O
the	O
drinks	B-A
	O
and	O

reason	O
there	O
are	O
4	O
different	O
results	O
on	O
citysearch	O
for	O
the	O
same	O
place	O
is	O
because	O
they	O
keep	O
trying	O
to	O
start	O
a	O

so	O
they	O
can	O

it	O

they	O

I	O
live	O
in	O
the	O
West	O
Village	O
and	O
I've	O
been	O
to	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O

Sometimes	O
you	O
pay	O
a	O

and	O
don't	O
get	O
much	O
in	O
return	O
-	O
it's	O
manhattan,	O
things	O
are	O
expensive.	O

However,	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
are	O
at	O

and	O
pleasant.	O

This	O

It	O
is	O
quite	O
a	O
spectacular	O

i'll	O
give	O
them	O
that.	O

The	O
decor	B-A
	O
however	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
distraction	O
so	O
you	O
won't	O
notice	O
that	O
you	O
just	O
payed	O
300	O

a	O

will	O
make	O
your	O

very	O

Only	O
complaint	O
is	O
the	O
pricing--I	O
believe	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
reasonable	O
to	O

We	O

It's	O
a	O
little	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
price	O
range	O
for	O
dining	O
there	O
except	O
on	O
special	O
occasions,	O
but	O
we've	O
eaten	O
there	O
6	O
times	O
in	O
the	O
last	O
2	O
years.	O

Each	O
time	O
we've	O
been,	O
the	O
front	B-A
of	I-A
house	I-A
staff	I-A
	O
(not	O
the	O
waiters	B-A
	O
-	O
they're	O
fantastic	O
-	O
but	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
greet	O
and	O
seat	O
you)	O
has	O
been	O
so	O
hideous	O
to	O
us	O
that	O
were	O
it	O
not	O
for	O
the	O
exceptional	O
fish	B-A
dishes	I-A
	O
I	O
would	O
never	O
return.	O
	O

As	O
BFC	B-A
	O
doesn't	O
take	O
reservations	O
you	O
almost	O
always	O
have	O
to	O
wait	O
by	O
the	O
bar	O
-	O
and	O
be	O
abused	O
by	O
the	O
front	B-A
of	I-A
house	I-A
staff	I-A
	O
until	O
you	O
are	O
seated,	O
which	O
can	O
be	O
over	O
an	O
hour	O
later!	O

The	O
frizzy	O
retro	O
girl	B-A
	O
(with	O
winged/	O
Dame	O
Edna	O
glasses)	O
will	O
yell	O
at	O
you	O
if	O
you	O
try	O
to	O
order	O
a	O
drink.	O
	O

I	O
was	O
almost	O
amused	O
by	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
turning	O
away	O
customers	O
at	O
9pm	O
on	O
a	O
Friday	O
night	O
because	O
she	O
"had	O
a	O
BBQ	O
to	O
go	O
to"	O
that	O
night	O
-	O
WTF??	O

I'd	O
be	O
horrified	O
if	O
my	O
staff	B-A
	O
were	O
turning	O
away	O
customers	O
so	O
early	O
and	O
so	O
rudely!	O

There's	O
another	O
girl	B-A
	O
who	O
I	O
can't	O
describe,	O
she	O
is	O
about	O
5'6"	O
with	O
brown	O
hair,	O
who	O
eavesdrops	O
on	O
your	O
conversation	O
and	O
chimes	O
in	O
-	O
except	O
she	O
only	O
hears	O
the	O
last	O
part	O
of	O
what	O
you	O
said,	O
so	O
her	O
uninvited	O
opinions	O
are	O
often	O
out	O
of	O
context	O
and	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
what	O
you're	O
*really*	O
talking	O
about.	O
	O

I'm	O
a	O
friendly	O
person,	O
so	O
I	O
wouldn't	O
mind	O
had	O
she	O
not	O
been	O
so	O
nasty	O
and	O
gotten	O
so	O
personal.	O

Again,	O
I'd	O
be	O
super	O
upset	O
if	O
that	O
were	O
my	O
employee.	O

Considering	O
you	O
will	O
spend	O
at	O
least	O
$60	O
a	O
head,	O
I	O
expect	O
better	O
service	B-A
.	O
	O

So,	O
if	O
you're	O
walking	O
by	O
and	O
thinking	O
about	O
dining,	O
you	O
might	O
want	O
to	O
see	O
who's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
seating	O
you	O
first...	O

Maitre-D	B-A
-"Eat	O
and	O
get	O
out"	O

My	O
family	O
ate	O
here	O
last	O
weekend.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
and	O
service	B-A
	O
were	O
fine,	O
however	O
the	O
maitre-D	B-A
	O
was	O
incredibly	O
unwelcoming	O
and	O
arrogant.	O

While	O
finishing	O
our	O
meals	O
which	O
included	O
a	O
high-end	O
bottle	B-A
of	I-A
wine	I-A
,	O
our	O
son's	O
fiance	O
joined	O
us	O
for	O
a	O
glass	O
of	O
wine	O
and	O
dessert.	O

This	O
guy	O
refused	O
to	O
seat	O
her	O
and	O
she	O
left,	O
followed	O
shortly	O
by	O
the	O
four	O
of	O
us,	O
but	O
not	O
before	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
in	O
my	O
40	O
years	O
of	O
world	O
travel,	O
including	O
Paris,	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
such	O
a	O
display	O
of	O
bad	O
behavior	O
by	O
a	O
frontman	B-A
	O
in	O
a	O
restaurant.	O

His	O
response	O
was	O
smug,	O
arrogant,	O
and	O
condescending,	O
totally	O
consistent	O
with	O
his	O
deportment	O
on	O
display	O
all	O
evening.	O

A	O
word	O
to	O

wise:	O
you	O
can't	O

here	O
and	O
disturb	O
the	O
maitre-D	B-A
's	O
sense	O
of	O
"	O
table	O
turnover",	O
as	O
whacked	O
as	O
it	O
is,	O

If	O
you	O

here,	O
do	O
it	O
on	O

at	O

at	O
Casa	B-A
la	I-A
Femme	I-A
	O
on	O
a	O
Saturday	O
dinner.	O

Appetizers	O
took	O
nearly	O
an	O
hour.	O

When	O
the	O
main	O
course	O
finally	O
arrived	O
(another	O
45mins)	O
half	O
of	O
our	O
order	O
was	O
missing.	O

Never	O
got	O
an	O
explanation	O
as	O
to	O
what	O
was	O
going	O
on.	O

The	O
manager	B-A
	O
was	O
rude	O
and	O
handled	O
the	O
situation	O
extremely	O
poorly.	O

When	O
we	O
threatened	O
to	O
leave,	O
we	O
were	O
offered	O
a	O
meager	O
discount	O
even	O
though	O
half	O
the	O
order	O
was	O
missing.	O

On	O
the	O
way	O
out,	O
we	O
heard	O
of	O
other	O
guests	O
complaining	O
about	O
similar	O
issues.	O

Can’t	O
believe	O
how	O
an	O
expensive	O
NYC	O
restaurant	B-A
	O
can	O
be	O
so	O
disrespectful	O
to	O
its	O
clients.	O

What	O
a	O
hassle!	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
very	O
good,	O
but	O
not	O
outstanding.	O

There	O
is	O
no	O
way	O
it	O
justifies	O
the	O

the	O

On	O

apology,	O
perhaps	O
even	O
a	O
glass	O
of	O
wine...but	O
not	O
the	O
grunt	O
that	O
we	O
received	O
from	O
the	O
Al	O
Di	O
La	O
staff	B-A
.	O

Without	O
the	O
wait	O
or	O
attitude,	O
I	O
would	O
probably	O
go	O
back,	O
but	O
there	O
are	O
just	O
too	O
many	O
other	O
restaurants	O
in	O
Brooklyn	O
that	O
are	O
as	O
good	O
or	O
better	O
and	O
don't	O
make	O
me	O
jump	O
through	O
hoops.	O

Expensive	O

I	O
went	O
there	O
after	O
hearing	O
how	O
great	O
it	O
was.	O

Wow.	O

The	O
bread	B-A
	O
was	O
stale,	O
the	O
salad	B-A
	O
was	O
overpriced	O
and	O
empty.	O

The	O
pasta	B-A
	O
was	O
well	O
cooked,	O
didn't	O
have	O
enough	O
sauce	O
though	O
or	O
flavor.	O

I	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
expensive	O
and	O
I	O
prefer	O
Bella	O
Via	O
just	O
blocks	O
away	O
by	O
far.	O

So	O
rude!!!	O

I	O
went	O
with	O
JWILS.	O

Her	O
review	O
is	O
above.	O

I	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
that	O
went	O
for	O
this	O
horrible	O
experience.	O

My	O
friend	O
is	O
100%	O
right	O
in	O
the	O
experience	O
we	O
had.	O

The	O
hostess	B-A
	O
was	O
rude	O
and	O
I	O
got	O
a	O
distinct	O
feeling	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
serve	O
us.	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
that	O
my	O
friend	O
left	O
out	O
is	O
that	O
when	O
we	O
sat	O
down	O
at	O
the	O
bar	O
the	O
bartender	B-A
	O
disappeared.	O

I	O
asked	O
for	O
a	O
menu	O
and	O
the	O
same	O
waitress	B-A
	O
looked	O
at	O
my	O
like	O
I	O
was	O
insane.	O

I	O
was	O
shocked	O
that	O
my	O
friends	O
wanted	O
to	O
stay	O
after	O
the	O
waitress	B-A
	O
said,	O
"can	O
I	O
help	O
you"	O
and	O
"how	O
many	O
are	O
in	O
your	O
party."	O

What?	O

The	O
three	O
of	O
us	O
standing	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
her	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
an	O
indication	O
of	O
how	O
many	O
of	O
us	O
there	O
were.	O

We	O
didn't	O
look	O
like	O
the	O
other	O
patrons	O
in	O
there	O
so	O
unfortunately	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
problem.	O

Shame	O
on	O
this	O
place	O
for	O
the	O
horrible	O
rude	O
staff	B-A
	O
and	O
non-existent	O
customer	B-A
service	I-A
.	O

bad	O
staff	B-A
	O

I	O
generally	O
like	O
this	O
place	B-A
.	O

The	O
food	B-A
	O
is	O
good.	O

The	O
design	O
of	O
the	O
space	B-A
	O
is	O
good.	O

But	O
the	O
service	B-A
	O
is	O
HORRID!	O

I	O
was	O
there	O
for	O
brunch	O
recently,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
tag	O
teamed	O
by	O
a	O
waitress	B-A
	O
and	O
a	O
waiter	B-A
.	O

The	O
waiter	B-A
	O
delivered	O
our	O
food	O
while	O
holding	O
what	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
plastic	O
bag	O
of	O
garbage	O
in	O
one	O
hand.	O

I	O
can't	O
believe	O
that	O
it	O
was,	O
but	O
please	O
put	O
the	O
bag	O
down	O
before	O
delivering	O
food!	O

The	O
waitress	B-A
	O
came	O
to	O
check	O
in	O
on	O
us	O
every	O
few	O
minutes,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
clear	O
the	O
plates	O
while	O
half	O
of	O
us	O
were	O
still	O
eating	O
(a	O
big	O
pet	O
peeve	O
of	O
mine	O
that	O
happens	O
almost	O
everywhere,	O
so	O
I	O
try	O
to	O
ignore	O
it).	O

I	O
couldn't	O
ignore	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
she	O
reach	O
over	O
the	O
plate	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
friends,	O
who	O
was	O
in	O
mid	O
bite,	O
to	O
clear	O
the	O
table.	O

She	O
then	O
put	O
the	O
check	O
down	O
without	O
asking	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
done,	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
check	O
on	O
the	O
bill	O
every	O
two	O
minutes,	O
even	O
though	O
we	O
were	O
one	O
of	O
three	O
occupied	O
tables.	O

I	O
wish	O
I	O
could	O
like	O
this	O
place	B-A
	O
more,	O
and	O
I	O
wish	O
someone	O
would	O
retrain	O
the	O
staff	B-A
.	O
